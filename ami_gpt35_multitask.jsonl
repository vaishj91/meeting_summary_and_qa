{"meeting_id":"ES2002a","dialogue":"B: Okay . B: Right . B: Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . B: Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . B: Do you want to introduce yourself again ? D: Great . A: Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . B: Okay . D: And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing expert . C: Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . B: Great . B: Okay . B: Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually . B: So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? B: And you all arrived on time . B: Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . B: Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . B: Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . B: Um and so there are three different stages to the design . B: Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . B: What did you get ? A: Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . B: Mm-hmm . A: Designing a remote control . D: Mm-hmm . A: That's about it , didn't get anything else . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , that's that's it . B: Is that what everybody got ? C: Yeah . A: Did you get the same thing ? B: Okay . D: Yeah . B: Um . B: So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . B: And repeat that process three times . B: Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . B: Um . B: So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . B: So who would like to go first ? D: I will go . D: That's fine . B: Very good . D: Alright . D: So This one here , right ? B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . D: Very nice . D: Alright . D: My favourite animal is like A beagle . D: Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? D: Is that right ? B: Yeah . D: Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . B: Yeah . D: And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . D: So this is blue . D: Blue beagle . D: My family's beagle . B: Right . B: Lovely . C: Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . C: Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them . B: Right . A: Cool . A: There's too much gear . B: You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . B: Ok oh we do we do . B: Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . A: Okay . D: I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . B: Ach why not We might have to get you up again then . D: Boy , let me tell you . B: I don't know what mine is . B: I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . D: Impressionist . A: Can't draw . B: Is that a whale ? A: Um . A: Yeah . A: Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . A: Um . A: Yes . A: Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . A: Allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice . B: Ah . A: Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . A: They come in and go eat everything in sight . A: And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . D: Alright . D: Mm . B: Okay . B: God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . B: Um . D: Superb sketch , by the way . A: Tail's a bit big , I think . B: I was gonna choose a dog as well . B: But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . D: Yep . B: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . B: Um That doesn't really look like him , actually . B: He looks more like a pig , actually . B: Ah well . D: I see a dog in there . B: Do you ? D: Yep . B: Oh that's very good of you . D: Now I see a rooster . B: Uh . D: What kind is it ? B: Um he's a mixture of uh various things . B: Um and what do I like about him , um That's just to suggest that his tail wags . B: Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . B: Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is quite amusing , so It is . D: Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? B: I think it is . B: He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . D: Hmm . A: It's an after dinner dog then . B: Yeah , so uh Yeah , maybe . D: Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . B: Maybe . B: Right , um where did you find this ? B: Just down here ? B: Yeah . B: Okay . B: Um what are we doing next ? B: Uh um . B: Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . B: Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . B: Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . B: And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . D: Kay . D: Um , can we just go over that again ? B: Sure . D: Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . D: Okay . D: So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? B: All together . D: Like on the shelf . B: Um I dunno . B: I imagine That's a good question . D: Our sale our sale anyway . B: I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . D: Yeah , okay okay . D: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um . D: Alright . B: But I I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? D: Yes . B: Think it will ? D: Mm-hmm . B: Um . D: Mm-hmm . B: Hmm . D: Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . B: Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . D: Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . B: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Hmm . B: Yeah . B: Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . D: Um . D: I don't know . D: Yeah . A: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . B: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . A: So , possibly . D: Yeah . B: Okay . D: And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . D: I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , something like that , yeah . B: What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? B: Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? B: Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . B: Marketing . B: Good marketing thoughts . D: Yep . B: Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . B: Um . D: Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uh-huh . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . B: Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? D: Mm-hmm . B: Or no , is it as much as that ? B: Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . D: Yep . D: Yeah , I'd say so , yeah . B: Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . D: No . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Um . B: But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um right , okay . B: Let me just scoot on ahead here . B: Okay . B: Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? D: Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah . B: Thin No , actually . B: That would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . A: Hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . B: Yeah , yeah . D: It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . B: Oh . D: It just comes along . B: Five minutes to end of meeting . B: Oh , okay . B: We're a bit behind . D: Do you know what I mean ? C: Yeah . D: Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . A: Yeah . D: Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . C: I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . D: But Right . D: Right . C: So um for them it was just how many devices control . D: Okay so Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so . B: Yeah . B: Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? D: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . D: They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . B: Mm-hmm . D: So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or um Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . B: Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . D: An Yeah . B: So extra functionalities . D: Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . D: So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . B: Mm-hmm . D: So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . D: But each one's got its own little part . B: Hmm . B: Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . B: Um I'll just check we've nothing else . B: Okay . B: Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? A: And you keep losing them . B: You keep losing them . D: Mm . B: Okay . A: Finding them is really a pain , you know . D: Mm . A: I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . D: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . D: Yeah . A: You know . D: That's just really good id Yep . B: There I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? D: Uh , sure . B: Dunno . B: Okay maybe . D: I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . D: Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . B: My goodness . D: And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . B: Still feels quite primitive . D: Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . B: Maybe like a touch screen or something ? D: S Something like that , yeah . B: Okay . D: Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . B: Uh-huh , okay . B: Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . D: Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . B: It looks better . B: Yeah . D: Um , nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway . B: Okay . B: Okay . C: Uh . B: Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . B: So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . B: Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . A: Yep . B: Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . B: Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . D: Okay . B: Um . B: Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . B: And uh and that's the end of the meeting . B: So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so Mm-hmm . D: Um . D: Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , um , do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , right ? B: Uh-huh , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? D: Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? B: Th Okay , well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . D: I I don't know . D: Yep . B: Um I guess that's up to us , I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know Yeah . D: Yeah , sure . D: Okay . A: I think one factor would be production cost . D: Okay , yeah . A: Because there's a cap there , so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . D: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: Um . B: Yeah . A: I think that that's the main factor . B: Okay . D: Okay . B: Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . D: Alright . B: Um . B: So , uh thank you all for coming . A: Cool .","summary":"The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal.

{"meeting_id":"ES2002b","dialogue":"B: Is that alright now ? B: Okay . B: Sorry ? B: Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? B: Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . D: Could you plug me in ? D: Okay . D: Thanks . B: All ready to go ? B: Okay . D: Okay . B: Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . B: Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . B: Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . B: Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . D: Kay . B: Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . B: I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . D: Okay . B: So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . B: And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . B: Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . B: It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . D: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? B: Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say Uh something Yeah , I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . D: Bout putting the fashion in electronics . A: Mm yeah . B: Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . B: So that's something we can discuss as well . B: So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . B: Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? A: Nope , we're all set . B: Right um , time for presentations then . B: Who would like to go first ? C: I'll go first . D: Sure . B: Okay , cool . C: Alright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? B: Oh yeah , of course , yeah . C: Uh so this is the technical functions design . B: G go on ahead . C: Um Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . B: Mm-hmm . C: Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . C: Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . D: Right . B: Okay . C: Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . C: Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um sh show you now . C: Uh here um the button there and there . B: Alright . C: This one's prog . C: Sorry . C: That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . C: Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . C: Um it's a very simple one . C: It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . B: Oop . C: Uh it looked a bit clunky . C: They're very big and not very much use for buttons . C: Um , and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . C: There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . C: Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . C: Um it's very easy to use . C: Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . C: Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . C: So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . C: Um not sure of how long we've got , uh Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . B: Um . B: Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . D: Mm-hmm . B: Just a couple of minutes anyway . D: M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . D: So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . B: Mm-hmm . D: But anyway , um we might come to that later . B: Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . A: Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . A: Okay . B: Yeah . D: Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? D: Larger ? C: Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . C: It's , you know , it's very spread out and kind of you know , I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . D: I see , so it's more just basic . B: Looks kind of Yeah . D: Right , okay . D: Yeah . C: got very few buttons on it and Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? D: Yeah . D: Sure . B: Well I think it's a valid point . B: I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . B: Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , I think that's a good idea . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: I think it's a good idea . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . C: I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . B: Mm-hmm . B: Uh-huh . C: Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . B: Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . C: Okay . C: Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? D: Which was that ? C: Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um Um , yeah . D: Up the numbers , or the up down ? B: God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , I mean would anybody disagree with that ? D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Um , what else , uh So don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , you know like brightness and contrast ? D: We don't ? D: No ? D: Yeah . D: Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . D: We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? B: Mm . D: Is that right ? D: Is that what we're we're doing ? B: Yeah . D: We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? C: Um Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible . B: I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? B: Mm-hmm . B: Okay , right . B: Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . D: Yeah . D: Yep . B: Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Right okay . C: There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . B: Um Mm-hmm yeah . D: Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . D: Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . D: For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . B: Oka Mm-hmm . D: Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . D: Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . D: And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . D: Something like that . B: Okay . B: Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no . B: Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . D: Yeah . B: Any of you anything to add to that at all ? A: No . B: No . A: I'll add it later , I guess the presentation . B: Okay , right . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: Um okay , if we can move on to next presentation then please . D: Sure . B: Um Do you wanna Probably not , actually . C: Do you want to switch places ? D: Can this can this pl reach ? D: Can this plug come across ? A: No . A: No . D: No . D: So why don't I just pick up and move then . B: Yeah . D: Here , I'll just Why don't I just Mm er , can you go up behind me ? C: Just just switch them . D: Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now . B: bit complicated . B: It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? D: Okay . B: Right . D: Um . D: So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . B: Oh , like overlap between what you said ? D: Yeah , yeah . B: Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen . D: Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . D: Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up ? B: Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah . B: Okay . A: Um function F_ eight . B: Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Alright . D: So F_ eight ? A: Function , the blue button . A: Next to the control on the left . D: Oh , and F_ eight . A: Yeah . B: Mm . A: You have to push it together . D: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . D: Okay , I think that that's doing it now . A: Nope . A: Try that again . D: Uh , again ? C: Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . A: Wait . D: Okay . B: Yeah , you wanna Oh oh here we go . D: Um , okay great . A: Yep , there we go . B: There you go . D: Okay . D: Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . D: And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . A: Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better . B: Um Okay . D: Okay . B: Right . B: Can you um Right , okay . A: There you go . D: Okay . D: Alright . D: That would be Okay . D: So um does that make sense ? D: So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . D: Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . D: So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . D: Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . D: Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno . A: Bouncing on top . D: Okay . B: Yeah . D: Um . D: So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . D: Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . D: So they find them ugly . D: Most people find them ugly . D: Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . D: Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . D: So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . B: Mm-hmm . D: So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . D: And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . D: Um , frustrations . D: They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . D: Um , takes time to learn how to use them . D: This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . D: If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . D: Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . B: Repetitive strain injury . A: Is installing a new remote control something that people Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . D: Uh , no , that did not come up at all . D: Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . D: I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . D: Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . D: So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . D: Um . D: And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . D: You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . B: Okay . B: So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . B: Okay . D: So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . D: You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . B: Mm . B: So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . D: Yeah . B: That's I think it's a good idea . D: Yeah . D: That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . B: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . D: But not let that confine us technologically . B: Okay . D: So Alright ? B: Right . D: Any um comments on all of that ? B: Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market . D: That's uh Yeah . B: Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? D: Okay . B: I mean Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . D: Where's the money , maybe . D: Yeah . B: Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . D: And who watches T_V_ . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . B: But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? A: Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? B: It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . A: Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? B: Yeah , okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: Right . A: Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . B: Okay . A: Kind of . A: You know how much ? A: I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? B: Okay . A: Like a simple replacement , right . B: Yeah . A: I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ? B: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . D: This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . D: These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . A: Yeah . D: Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . B: Okay Okay . D: Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . B: Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? A: Yep . D: Sort of young professional , kind of . B: Yeah , okay . D: Mm-hmm Uh , yeah , it's the Yep . C: Um Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? B: Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? B: What what do you think , Craig ? C: Sort of the the older group . C: Uh f Yeah . D: It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , in terms of Okay . B: N yeah . B: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . D: Yeah . D: Sure . D: Sure . D: Yeah . B: So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . D: Mm-hmm . B: So we could say that was our target . A: I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm-hmm . B: Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . D: Mm-hmm . A: I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: But yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , sure . B: So Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: So these are people who are gadgety , right ? A: People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular Yeah . B: Yeah . B: So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: That that's that's a good point . A: Mm . B: Um okay , so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can . D: If we can . A: I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . D: Yeah . B: Okay . B: Why is that ? A: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . A: Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . D: Right . B: Okay . D: Could it be an on off thing ? A: Um , but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . D: Like if you want it on Yeah . B: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Sure . D: Sure . A: So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . B: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Sure . B: Uh-huh . D: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Sure . D: Yep . B: Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah . A: Okay , sure . D: Yep . D: Yeah , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . D: Um Not Yeah . B: Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . B: Um . D: And not losing . D: And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they Right . B: Mm-hmm . C: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . B: Really ? C: Channel up . D: Oh really , you've seen one before . B: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? C: Um I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . A: Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . B: Mm . B: Course not . A: Thanks . A: Cool , um . B: There you go . A: Okay . A: Um . B: Right . A: Well this is just the working design um . B: Mm-hmm . A: Well this is just what how I would go about it . A: Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . A: Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . D: Right . A: We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . A: Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? A: Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . A: But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that . A: Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . A: It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um okay , you need some power source . A: Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . B: Uh-huh . A: Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . D: Mm-hmm . A: Like for example , voice recognition , right . A: That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . A: Um Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . B: Hmm . A: You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . A: So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . A: Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . A: It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . B: Mm-hmm . A: So it's not really a constraint in that sense , but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do . B: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . B: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? A: I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? D: Kay . B: Uh . B: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? D: Sure . D: Sure . A: Yeah , w I'm done . B: Are you are you all done ? A: More or less . A: Yeah . A: Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . D: Yep . B: Mm . A: Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , you know , stuff like that . B: Okay . B: Okay . D: Right . A: Um I guess this would be Yep . B: Right . D: And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? D: Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Right . A: Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . A: This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed . D: The basic principle of 'Kay . B: Okay . D: Right . B: Mm-hmm . A: For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . D: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . B: Oh . D: Okay . B: So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . A: Uh Yep . B: Okay . A: Yep . A: So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . B: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . B: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . A: Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . B: Okay . A: Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? D: Okay . B: Okay . A: Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . B: Okay . D: Right . A: Right . B: Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha Mm-hmm Oh , yeah . A: Yep . A: There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . A: Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . A: I it you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . D: Right . D: Right . B: Yeah , mm-hmm . B: Okay . A: Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: Okay . A: So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . D: Right . D: Okay . A: Not so much further down . B: Okay . D: And um just a clarification before we finish this . D: Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? A: There's there's not much specific specific information , but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . B: W Yeah . D: Okay . A: Because infra-red is something which everybody has . B: W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , so that's what we should do for now I think . D: Just to T_V_ , okay . D: Okay . B: Something I was wondering about was the power . B: Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? B: I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? A: There's a there's Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . B: Uh-huh . B: Uh-huh . A: You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . A: Or you need to get the user to plug it in . A: Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . B: Okay , so Yeah . A: But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Okay , so just stick to to regular Okay . A: Um . B: Um , right . B: So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . D: Okay . D: Okay . B: So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? D: Yeah , that's good . B: Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . B: Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? C: Um . C: I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . C: Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . B: Okay , right . C: Ta . D: And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? C: Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . D: Okay . B: Okay . A: Okay , I think Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? D: R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . B: Yeah , it's as optional functions . C: Yeah . D: I dunno if that'd be a problem . B: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . D: Yeah . D: Okay . A: One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . D: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . D: Right . D: Yeah . D: Kay , okay . A: I mean it might help with the visualisation . D: Like that . D: Okay . A: And it would actually help with the component build as well . D: Mm-hmm . B: Okay , right . D: Mm okay , great . B: Um , okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . B: Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . B: Whoohoo . B: Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . B: Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . B: Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . B: So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . B: Um , do you wanna start with David . B: Anything else to say at all ? A: Mm no , not really . B: No , okay . D: Um yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . B: Andrew ? B: Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . B: Uh-huh . D: Shall we do that , then ? A: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Okay , great . C: Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? A: Um things like on off . A: Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . B: Yeah . A: I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , um so um And channel . B: Okay . D: And and channel . D: Right . A: Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . A: Not on off video . B: Yeah . A: Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . B: Okay . B: Okay . A: Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . B: Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay . A: We put it out . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . D: Mm-hmm . A: You you put that into audio . B: Okay , and then visual Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , stuff like that . D: Mm-hmm . A: And then video is anything that you can see . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um . A: Yep . D: Colour , yeah . A: Yep . D: Sure . D: Sure . A: Yep . D: Okay . B: Okay , um Mm-hmm . D: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah . A: Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . B: Yeah . D: Sure , okay . B: Okay . D: Okay . A: Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . A: It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed . B: Okay . D: Okay . B: Okay . B: Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . B: Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . D: Mm-hmm . B: Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , you know , things like that . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um , so I guess I guess that's it . D: Great . B: That's the meeting over . B: Whoohoo . D: Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us .","summary":"The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product. The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist. The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources. The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them. The industrial designer will work on the components concept. The user interface designer will work on the user interface. The marketing expert will work on trend watching The team will not work with teletext. The remote will only control televisions. The corporate color and design must be incorporated into the design of the remote. The remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off, channel up and down, volume up and down, and entering channel numbers. The remote has to look good and be easy to use. The target demographic is people aged fifteen to thirty five. The remote will use an infra-red sensor. The remote will use regular batteries. How to categorize the functions on the remote. How to implement the categorization of functions in the design of the remote. Defining a target demographic. Whether to include speech recognition as a feature in the remote. How to incorporate more advanced functions into the remote while keeping the design and usability of the remote simple.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to finalize the functional design of a new remote control. Participants included B, who led the meeting, D, C, and A, each contributing their expertise in design, technology, and marketing. The key discussion topics revolved around three new requirements: eliminating teletext functionality, restricting the remote to TV control only, and incorporating the company's corporate color and slogan.

{"meeting_id":"ES2002c","dialogue":"A: S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah . D: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Yeah , sure . B: Okay , well Okay . D: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . A: Yep . D: Everything I have is kinda background . B: Okay we all ready to go ? A: Yep . B: Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . B: And we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . A: Yep . D: Mm-hmm . B: And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . B: Um so that was the last meeting . B: Is there anything have I forgotten anything ? A: Mm-hmm . A: No . D: Uh that sounds . B: Is that everything ? B: Okay . B: Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . B: That might be a better idea this time . D: Sure . B: And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , if that's alright . D: Okay . D: Sure . B: Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . A: Yep . D: Yeah , cool . B: So if you wanna take this . D: Why don't I get that ? D: Hmm . B: Screwed in quite tightly . B: Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? B: We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Right . B: Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . D: Okay . B: So um that's kind of the end result hopefully . D: Okay . D: Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ? B: Uh-huh . B: Hopefully appear in a wee second . D: Hmm . D: Come on . D: I think it's working . B: Up there we go . D: Okay great s so let me just start this . D: Okay great . D: So um uh s move on . D: Uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? D: It's not good . B: Oh no . D: Okay lemme just see where I can find it . D: This looks more like it . D: I think I just opened up the template . D: Sorry about that . B: Oh right . D: Okay alright so let's have a look here . D: Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . B: Here we go . D: Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . B: Okay . D: And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . D: Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . D: Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . D: I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . B: Aye a fair point definitely . D: Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . B: Okay . D: Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . D: Number two was that it be innovative . D: Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . D: Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . D: So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . D: For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . B: Aye right . B: Uh-huh . D: So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? D: Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . B: Okay . D: Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . D: Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . D: And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what I mean ? B: Okay okay . D: So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . D: Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it . D: And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . D: So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . D: Um So these this is the summary of everything . D: Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . D: Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . D: That was like the number three thing . D: And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . B: Mm-hmm . D: You know what a Mac iPod is ? B: Mm that's true , yeah . D: I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . D: Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . D: Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . D: Um Does that make sense ? D: Yeah . D: So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . B: Mm 'kay . B: Great . D: Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . D: Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway it's just just an idea . B: Okay . B: Yeah . D: I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . D: Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . B: Ah . D: How can we build on that ? D: Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . B: Okay . D: Anyway those are that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep . B: That's great . B: Uh-huh . B: Okay great . B: Um thank you for that . B: Uh Craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then ? C: Is it working ? B: Mm . B: Not quite . D: Did you press F_ eight ? A: It's probably not sending . A: Yeah . B: Oh something coming now , yeah . A: Yep , there it is . B: There we go . C: And so think of this concept . C: Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . C: It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . C: Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um So then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . B: Mm . C: Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . C: Um they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . C: Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . B: Mm-hmm . C: Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . C: Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . C: It's uh something the user then uh identify with . C: This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . C: Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . C: Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um The buttons should be large . C: They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . C: They should be easy to press , very comfortable . C: Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . B: Mm-hmm . C: Um should avoid s things like that . C: Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . B: Okay . C: Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . D: Yeah . D: Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? D: I didn't know . B: I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after . D: Okay . A: And the Play-Doh 's yellow . D: Okay . C: Fantastic . D: Okay . C: Um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . D: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . C: That's just wrong . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm 'kay . C: And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . B: Mm . C: So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility . B: Aye that's a good idea , yeah . C: Right and these are problems I've had with it . C: Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . C: I think it's um , fashion into electronics . B: Yeah . C: And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . C: I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or That's it . D: Mm . D: Mm . B: Okay . A: Cool . B: Okay . D: Great . D: Lots of good information there . B: Yeah that that was very good , and uh now with David . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm 'kay um . C: I think I'm cool . D: It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , huh ? B: I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . D: Just um It takes a second , doesn't it ? A: Oops . B: Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um Yeah . A: Yeah okay . A: Let me just get this going first . A: Ah there it is . A: Kay , that should be it . A: Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . A: So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um the components are exactly the same . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . A: The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . A: Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . A: And the power is basically a factor of that . A: Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . D: Mm-hmm . A: So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . A: So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . A: These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . A: So just go through it in the components . A: Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . C: Right . A: Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . A: I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . D: Mm . B: Hmm . A: So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , um I think these are quite standard things . C: Right . B: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . D: They're standard , aren't they ? A: No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . A: I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . D: Yeah . A: Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . A: It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . B: Mm-hmm . B: We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? A: Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . B: Yeah . A: They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . D: Hmm . B: Mm 'kay . A: Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so I think that there is some restriction on um I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . B: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: You know as opposed to two . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . A: The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . A: Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Power consumption should be about the same . A: Um I think the main impact is complexity , um and the other thing is um the power options . D: Hmm . A: Um the first one is a standard battery . A: Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . B: I'll clear one of these things for you . B: Just by moving it yeah . D: Hmm . A: Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . A: I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . B: Mm . D: No . A: Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . D: Yeah . A: So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . B: Mm . A: From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . D: Mm-hmm . A: You know you know you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . B: W yeah . D: Hmm . B: Uh yeah yeah , I see . D: Yeah . D: Hmm . A: You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , kind of you know just uh you know um so . B: Yeah . D: Hmm . B: I know what you mean yeah . A: Um okay my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . D: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . A: Um The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . B: Mm . A: Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . A: Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . B: Okay . A: Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood . D: It can't be curved . D: Okay . A: So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . B: Okay . B: Right . A: So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . B: Okay . B: Right can I Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away . A: That's it . D: Uh question on can I ask a question ? D: Okay . D: Can we uh power a light in this ? D: Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? A: Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . B: Mm . D: Okay . D: So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . B: Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? D: Well I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? B: Uh-huh . B: Yeah . D: Illuminate the buttons . D: Yeah it glows . D: Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does . A: Okay . D: Oh where's the volume button in the dark , and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . B: Yeah yeah yeah . A: Okay . B: Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . A: Okay . D: Like a phone , yeah yeah . B: Okay cool . D: Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . B: Yeah . D: We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . A: Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . D: But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? B: Mm . D: Right . A: So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness . D: Sure . B: Mm . B: Okay . D: Okay . D: Right . B: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . B: Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . D: Okay , great . D: Okay . B: So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . B: So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . D: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Um I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? B: I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? C: Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . C: Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . B: So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy ? C: Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . B: Okay um right okay . B: Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that Whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . A: I think he made that . D: What's that ? D: Yeah . B: Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . D: Okay . B: Um And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? D: Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . B: That's all . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . D: Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , you said company colour yellow . B: Mm-hmm . D: I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . B: Mm-hmm . D: We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things . B: Okay . B: Right . A: Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? A: Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? A: Does it need with a square thing wha Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit . B: Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material yeah . D: Yeah . B: Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . A: I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . C: See I'm I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . B: It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . D: Yeah . B: And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either . D: No no no not at all . D: It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . D: Do you know what I mean ? B: Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . B: A snowman shape ? C: Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . B: Uh-huh . B: That's quite a distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . D: Right , sure . D: Yeah . B: Yeah so yeah should we go with that ? D: Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . B: Do you wanna draw it on the board ? C: Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there . D: Okay . B: Ooh that'd be good . D: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yep . B: So call it the snowman-shape trademark . B: Yeah that's cool . B: Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? B: I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . B: I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something Uh-huh . D: Mm . C: So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . B: Okay cool . B: Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? B: The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . B: Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . C: I think that might scare me . B: I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? C: I think that'd probably scare me . C: You turn it on your control possessed s . B: I know . B: Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? B: Would we put that on the inside or It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . C: Um Nah . A: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? A: What what's the functionality of that ? A: Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? D: What would it achieve ? A: Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mm-hmm . D: Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . D: And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . D: So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . B: Yeah . A: I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know . D: Right , okay . B: Mm oh yeah that's true . B: Yeah . B: So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? B: I think that would make it very complex . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Mm not real Mm-hmm . A: We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? B: I don't know if there is really , no um I would say no need for a talk-back . A: Um You could put a game on it . B: Uh does anybody disagree with that ? D: No . B: No ? B: Easy . A: When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control . D: Mm mm . B: Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? C: Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . B: Okay . C: B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . B: Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ? D: Well i I was just Yeah . A: Where would you physically position the buttons ? A: Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . D: Yeah . C: Um Yeah I think so yeah . A: Um maybe you wanna draw onto the Yep . B: So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about . B: Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . B: Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? B: I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , I mean what does anybody think about that ? D: Yeah , sure . D: Um I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches yeah Sure , okay , right , okay . A: No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just Yeah . B: Okay . D: Support for it . D: I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . B: Mm-hmm . D: I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . B: Yeah . A: Yep . D: Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . B: Yeah . D: So we should think about Yeah . B: Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . B: So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . D: Yep . B: Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . B: Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? A: Yes yes . B: Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay . D: And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . D: Um just a a lot of the um I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm 'kay . D: Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? D: Like Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . B: Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . A: Or even a clear case . A: Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . D: Yeah clear , that'd be Okay . B: Aye that would be a good idea . D: Yeah sure . A: Um in in a slight subtle way . B: S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . D: Yeah that'd be really good . A: Yeah yeah . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Is that what you mean ? A: Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . D: Sure . A: You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . D: Yeah , yeah . A: So the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . D: Yeah . D: Sure . D: Yeah they they emanate a light through it . B: Okay . B: Lights . D: Kay . D: Yeah , mm-hmm . B: Okay . D: Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . B: Mm . D: Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? A: The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? D: Or Yeah . A: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? A: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? A: Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . C: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? D: Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? B: If you're holding it in your hand you could Do you think ? A: That's a very unnatural motion to yeah . B: Okay . A: Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . A: Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . D: Yeah . B: Mm . A: If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah okay okay um Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , sure . A: Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno . D: Mm . C: Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . A: But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Okay . C: Uh but Yeah . B: Okay . D: But that's not a bad thing is it ? B: Just Okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . D: Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . D: Jog dials are much easier than that . D: You just roll . B: Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? B: No . B: And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? D: Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small I dunno . B: Uh-huh . B: Uh-huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up so yeah . D: Yeah . D: It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that yeah well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? B: Okay well if we can do that , great . B: Yeah okay . B: Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and Mm . D: Yeah . D: And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the It would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . A: So you wanna expand the shape of the That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . D: Yeah . D: Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . C: Mm . A: Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? B: Okay . B: Right I'm gonna have to I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . D: A jog di Yeah . D: It's kind of yeah Yeah . B: Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? B: Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . B: So um that'll be that'll be good . D: Huh . B: Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . B: Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? B: Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? D: Um Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be great . A: Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um Yeah that's what I was thinking the a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . D: Yeah . D: Yep . A: I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . A: There's lots of space for it um Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function Yeah . B: Okay . B: That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . D: Sure , yeah , yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: To make something flush with the case ? D: Something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . B: Okay right . B: Okay . B: Sp kinda grippy ? A: Feel like fruit . B: Okay . A: Fruits kids . D: They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , kind of a little bit like Okay . A: No like Yeah yeah . A: Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . B: Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . B: So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . B: So off you go and design stuff wooh . D: Okay . A: Play-doh time . B: Yeah quite jealous actually . A: You got to choose first . A: No , we're kidding . A: Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . A: Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . A: It's you . A: Argh . A: This is a real hassle and a oops . A: I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again . A: Cool .","summary":"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.

{"meeting_id":"ES2002d","dialogue":"B Okay we all all set ? B Right . B Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . B Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . B And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . B So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . B Anything I've missed ? A No . B Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead . D Uh-oh . D This is it ? A Ninja Homer , made in Japan . D Um , there are a few changes we've made . D Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button . B Okay . B Mm . B Mm-hmm . C Mm 'kay . D Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . A And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? A So the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . C Where are they ? A Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? C Ah , right . A Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . C Great . B So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mm-hmm . A If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . C Right . C Okay . C Right . C Right , 'kay . B Okay cool . A It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . C Okay . C Mm-hmm , and what is this here ? B Oh right okay . B Cool . A That's a number pad . C Okay so the number pad is 'Kay , great . B Where are we gonna have the slogan ? A Um they're al along this Yeah . D You know , just like right inside there . B Okay cool . A You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . B Okay . A Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . C Mm . C Yep . B Okay . C Looks good . C Yep . C Mm-hmm . B So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? D Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . B Mm-hmm . C Okay . A Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . A Plus maybe half o five six seven eight , about yeah nine total . C Mm-hmm . C About nine in total . B Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . B So we're talking about ten centimetres . C That sounds good . C Yeah . B That would be good . C Yep . B So ten centimetres in height . A Nine , ten . A Yep . B Okay um . C That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . B Yeah . B That's great and it's very bright as well . C Mm . B So um okay . C Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . C Is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? D Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . C Right . D Um But um this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . B Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . B Mm-hmm . D Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial . A Excuse me . A Sure . B Okay . B Okay so that's like an okay button , right . C Mm-hmm . A Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? D I don't know . B Okay . C How high is it ? A No as in the height , but what about the width ? C Yeah . D Didn't put five centimetres . B Oh oh like depth of the actual thing . A Do we need five ? A I don't think five is be about th three and a half . D Um . C Okay . D Something by there . B Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . A Yeah , yeah . C Sure . B So you can power on and off , what else can you do ? C Three and a half . D Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . B Okay . D Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . B Okay jog-dial for volume . B And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? C Mm-hmm . D Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and Um yeah . B Contrast , brightness , yeah , and anything else ? D Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the Uh what can a T_V_ do ? B Well of the designers what are they ? A Okay things like um brightness , contrast , um maybe tuning the channels . B Uh-huh . B Okay channel tuning . A Um . B That's a good one . A What else ? A Um the various inputs . A Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having you know which input do you have ? C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B Okay auxiliary inputs . C Mm-hmm , probably colour or sharpness . A Um . A Yep , colour , sharpness . B Sharpness . A Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . C Mm-hmm . B Okay what about uh sound settings ? B Uh d can you change any of those at all ? C Audio . A Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . D Um . A Um . D the the balance hmm . A Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . B Okay . C Mm-hmm . B Okay , is there anything else at all it can do ? C Mm 'kay . A Yeah . B That 'cause that's that's fine . B Just need to know so I can write it down . B Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all . D Mm-hmm . B So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? A The battery . B Do we have kinetic as well ? A No . B No . B Okay , just battery . A Um . A We need an Yep . B And that's because of cost restraints is it ? D Yeah . B Okay um what about the electronics here ? A Yeah advanced chip . A We need an advanced chip I think , yep . B Advanced chip . A Let me just confirm that . A Yes I think so . A Yep . B Okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? D Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . A Yeah . B So we want double-curved ? A Yep . B Okay . B Um . A Plastic . B Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay , um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? A I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . A Um . A Yep . B So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ? A For the case itself , one colour . A It's one special colour . B Just one colour , okay . A Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . B Okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? C Mm . A Yes . A One and the L_C_ display . B Okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? A How many We've got push buttons as well . D Um we have um got some push buttons as well . C Or even clear . B Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay . D Kay . D So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . B Uh-huh . D I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . B Okay . A Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . B Okay . A Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . B Four . B So w why are we arriving at the number four ? B Where does the number four come from ? A Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . B Okay right , so we're writing down four . A So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . B Okay . B How about these ? B Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? A No . A Yep . A Yep . B Okay . B So we're w w quite far over . B Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . B Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , so let me see , what are we I mean oh yes sorry , four point three . C Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three ? C Four point three no ? B My maths is all out . B Yeah . C And then where is the Mm-hmm . A How much would that save us ? B How much would that save us ? A That will only save you one . D That is one . B One . A The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep . D That's fair enough , yeah . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . B Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . B Um take away the L_C_ display ? A And the advanced chip goes away as well . C Mm-hmm . B To be replaced with a regular chip . A Regular chip . A Yep . C Mm-hmm . B Okay . A So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there . B And so we've got point three to get rid of . B Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? B Twelve buttons . D That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . B Yeah . A Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah , so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . B Do you think ? B Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? A It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . C Mm-hmm . B Mm . C Mm-hmm . B Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . A We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . B Mm . B No can do . C Yeah we could just go with um Hmm . A Normal coloured buttons . B Well do you want colour differentiation here ? A No that's not the button we're talking about . B Oh yeah sorry yeah then . A That's the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh ? B Right so Ah . A Hey it's back to the original . B That's it . A Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . C Mm-hmm . C Mm . B Okay , ach that's a shame . B Um right , so take away that completely ? B Ah . B And now we're under budget . B So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . B Um Doesn't say so . C How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? C Yeah . C That's a freebie . A Yeah . B Yeah that's a good idea . B Just one ? B Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay . D I think there's just one button so handy . B Well well there we go . B So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . B So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . B Um . C Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? A What do you mean by profile ? D Yeah . C Sort of flat as possible . A No . D You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . C Yeah . C Yeah that's what I was thinking , to Sure , okay . A We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . C Yeah alright yeah fair enough . C Okay , just thought I'd ask . A So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . C Mm-hmm . B Right okay . A Yeah . B So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? A Yeah . B Okay and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being ? C Hmm . B About that big ? D Yeah it works , yeah . A Two . B About two centimetres , okay . C Two's not very high at all though . C Maybe a bit higher ? A This is about this is about two . A Slightly more than two , so Okay . D See , about that thick . C Yeah . B Okay . C Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . B Ach , that is Yeah . B Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . B Okay um so we have it within cost anyway . B Um so yeah project evaluation is this point . B Um . C Mm-hmm . B Right uh . B Okay so can we close that ? B This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . C Mm-hmm . B Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine . C Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah . A I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . C Sure , okay . A The the look and the colour is something which is cool , but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad . C Yeah , alright . C Okay , sure . C What about button shape ? C Square buttons ? C Okay . C Yeah . C Sure . D Yeah . C Yeah . B Okay . B Right um . B So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . C Mm 'kay . B Um , let me see uh Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was Yeah , yeah go for that first . C Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? A Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . C Or Evaluation . B I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it . C Okay . C Sure . C Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , I'll try and do it as quick as possible . B Okay . B Okay . C Um , this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay . B Yeah . A I don't think you need the power , so No , that's okay that's okay . C What's that ? C I don't need the PowerPoint ? A No , the power cord itself . C Oh course , yeah that's true . A Yeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers . C Let me get that . C A bit more . C Okay , so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . D Is it ? A You killed a monster . C Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? B Oh there it is . C Yeah , okay great . C Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it . C Okay , so um So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . B Mm 'kay . C So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement . B Okay . C Okay ? C So the first one uh , stylish look and feel . A I rate that pretty highly . B Well yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . D Yeah . C Yeah . B I dunno like a six or something . C Yeah . C Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . B What does anybody else think ? B Mm . B Mm . C But What do you guys think ? B Okay . D I'm seeing five then . B I would say five or six . C Okay . B David ? A Yep I'm fine with that . C Okay let's go with five then . B Okay . C Fi oh uh just actually the opposite . A It's one to seven , right ? C The So it meant three , okay . B Oh yes sorry then , then I would say two or three . A Wait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ? D One's high-ish isn't it ? B Yeah . C Yeah , one is high . D Ah , okay so yeah , two or three . C Kay Let's go with two point five then . A Okay , it's upside-down . C Okay , um control high tech innovation . B Well it has the wee jog-dial but Mm . C We had to remove Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good . B I'd go with three or four , maybe three . A Say it's more medium , but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . D Eight three . C Okay , three ? B Yeah about three , okay . A Yep . C Okay , um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . C I shouldn't have said colour , but just Sorta . A Lemon . B Well that's kind of But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ? A Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the b the the red button , they because for want of a Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . D Yeah . C Yeah . C Okay . C Right . C Yeah , could be . C Yeah . C Okay . B Yeah . C Okay so we'll go two . B Mm-hmm . C Yeah ? C Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . B Well yeah , I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ? C F f yeah f fairly basic , you guys think ? B I mean I'd give that nearly a one . D Yeah one . A Yep , that's fine . C Yeah , one ? C Okay . C Um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? C We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . D Yeah I think it's about five . C Five ? B Five ? B That's really low . D Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be I think I'd probably increase the cost . B Well Yeah I suppose mm 'kay . C That's Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? A Yeah , company logo . C Was that an option ? A I think it'll be cost prohibitive , yeah . D We've only got like what , ten cents left so Yeah . C It would cost more than plastic . C Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? A Yep . B Yep . B Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ? C Huh . C And um it's within budget , yep . C It is , isn't it ? C Okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ? B Out of forty nine , I guess . C Yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . C We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . B S pretty good . C So it's pretty good . C Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . C Right ? B Uh yeah . C I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . B Twice that , about thirty one . B So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . B It's pretty good . C Okay , good . C That was just a little formality for us to go through . B Okay . C Yep , oh hundred pound pen . C Sorry alright . B Nobody saw it , honestly . C No . A The cameras did . C Hmm . B Is that you all have all finished , or Uh-huh . C Yeah that's that's me . C I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . C It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . B Mm-hmm . A Yep . B Okay . C It's just discussion . C I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . C I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . C Um , yep so there . B Right . C That's all . B Okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? B I don't know what your instructions have been . C Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . C Yeah . B Okay , uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great . C I will , yeah . A It keeps getting too big . B Cool . B Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . A Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . B Oh right , okay . A Just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? C Huh . A Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego . D My leg . B Right , okay . B Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . B You got a different uh Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . C Yep . C I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . C It's really quick . B Right okay , um yeah here we are . C To use . B Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically . B Um do you wanna start Andrew ? C Sure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ? B I don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . C Or sort of our work on setting this up . B Yeah . C Yeah . C Well , is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then . C The the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a d debating Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . B Uh-huh . B Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? B But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . B I think it means like you know Yeah . C Oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . B Room . B Oh yeah . C No , of course , yeah . B Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mm-hmm . C Sorry . C Huh . C Yeah . C Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . B Mm . C So what do we do . C We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah . B Okay . A You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . B Okay . A The constraints do come in very fast . C Yeah , yeah . B Okay uh do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . C So Yeah . B Yeah . B So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . D Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . B Yeah . A Yeah . C Yep . A I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . C Yeah . B Yeah . C Yeah . A Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B Mm . C Yeah , yeah . A And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . C Yeah . C Yeah , sure . B Yeah . C Yeah . C New creativity . A I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . C Yep . C Right . B So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah , but actual environment ? A Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me . C Mm . C Mm-hmm . B Okay . C Mm-hmm . B Okay . B Very good . B Um what about leadership ? B I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something . B I don't really know . C Yeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader . B From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? B Okay . C Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good . C I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know , innovative thought with . B Mm-hmm . C In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . C And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . B Uh-huh , okay . C It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . B So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay . A I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . C Yeah maybe not co confining . A I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . C Yeah . C Yeah , yeah . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B Uh-huh . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . B Okay . A It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go . C Mm . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C Yeah . B Okay , uh what about teamwork ? C Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? D Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . C Yeah . B Yeah . D If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . C Yeah . B Okay . C Fully agree . B Mm . C Yeah . B Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ? C Yeah . D Not just yet . A Yeah . B Oh that's alright . C Yeah , got the email . B I was wondering if that got there okay . A Okay . B Okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . C Yeah . C Yeah , in it Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , exactly . A I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . A They don't support the team working together , you know , they're still very individual tools . B Oh right , okay . C Yeah , I mean if you Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that's what teamwork is . B Mm . A We had Play-Doh fun . B Yeah . C To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . B Yeah . B Okay . C Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . B Okay . C I'm not dissatisfied with it . B Right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? A No , not really . B Okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? B Um did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f unsupportive ? C Mm-hmm . C I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . B Mm . C Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . C I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . B Mm-hmm . B Yeah . B And point at ? B Yeah . C It wasn't until we had this here , you know , like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book . B Yeah . B Ah . C But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be , yeah . B So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? A I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . B Yeah . C Yeah , yeah . C Yeah . C Yeah , yeah . C Mm-hmm . A It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint , or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place , you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings . C Mm-hmm . C Yeah . C Yeah , yeah . B Okay . C Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . B Alright . B Okay uh Yeah . C Mm-hmm . D Yeah . A Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . C Yeah . A And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them . B Yeah . C No , not quite . C Yeah . C Yeah . B Okay . C Yeah . B What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? D Oh they're a bit clunky . C Sure , yeah . A Yep clunky . A Agreed . B Yeah . C Yeah . C Yep . B Clunky , okay . C Mm . B Um Yeah . A Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . C Mm . B I know , I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something , but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since . C Yeah . C Hmm . C Hmm . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C Hmm . A But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B Yeah , yeah . A So I think the pen's good . A It's about the best thing . C And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . B Yeah . C It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer . A Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting . B Yeah , that's true . C If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . D Good point . C Yeah . C Yeah . C Yeah . B Yeah . B Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? D Yeah . B Okay . A Um Yep . B I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um I don't know about anybody else . C Mm-hmm . C Yep . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . B Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . B Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? D Is this for the project or Oh yeah . C Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . B Mm . C So , that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . B Yeah if we just had uh Mm-hmm . B Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah . C Oh yeah . C Yeah , yeah . C Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but There you go . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . C Mm-hmm . C Hmm . B Um so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . B Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . B Wonderful . B Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . B And is the project evaluated , yes it is . B So now celebrate . C Great . C So it So now we I I don't know . A And we have Ninja Homer . B Well apparently now I write the final report . D Do we know what the other ones are ? B What are you guys doing now ? B You dunno ? D Oh wow . C Hmm . B That is lovely . D Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer . C What did you call it ? A Ninja Homer . A See it looks like Homer Simpson but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . C Huh , huh . B So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? C Logo . A Yeah it's just a logo . B Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , right okay . C Huh . A Ninja Homer . C Mm . A The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . C Mm-hmm . B I think it's quite nice . C Fashion technology or something . A You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . C Hmm , hmm , hmm . B Oh no , that's cool , it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice . C Hmm . A It's clunky . C Yeah , yeah . B Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . C Mm-hmm . A Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . C Hmm . B Play-Doh s Really ? A No it is it is . A It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . C Huh . C Huh . A Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . C Yeah . B Yeah . A Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . B Did they ? A You might wanna write that down . C Yeah . A It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . B Okay . B Play-Doh . C No , it's true , yeah . D Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . C Hmm . B Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . C And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ? B Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be , yeah . A No , all Play-Doh is edible . D I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . A It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh It's helpful to the creative process . C Wow , hmm . B Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? C Huh . A Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . B Okay . C Yep . A And it helps you to understand dimension as well . C Taste .

A I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . B Um Well I dunno . B Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now . A Can we turn off the microphones ? B Yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so .","summary":"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options. The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality. The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process. The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork. *NA* The remote will not contain a kinetic battery. The remote will have a regular chip. The case will be double-curved. The remote will have push buttons. The remote will not feature an LCD display. The display will be on the television instead of on the remote. The buttons will be normal colored. The remote will have square buttons.

A: So yeah , I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: So uh Mm . C: Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , yeah . D: Yeah the universal ones . D: Yeah . C: So presumably that might be an idea to put into . A: But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . B: Slim . A: For sure . D: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . C: Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? D: Mm-hmm , it's about that . C: And that's quite a lot for a remote control . A: Yeah , yeah . D: Mm . D: Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . D: As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? C: Uh-huh . C: Mm-hmm . D: Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . D: Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ? C: Okay . C: The the keyrings , yeah yeah . D: Because we always lose our remote control . A: Right . C: Okay , that's cool . B: Uh yeah uh , being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? B: What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? B: What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . C: Okay . B: So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . D: Okay . D: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , so , yes , all this . D: Yeah . C: Okay . C: Kay . A: Uh , what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this ? C: So , we're looking for 'Kay . C: We're Sorry , carry on . A: Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . D: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Then you lose it , yeah . C: Okay . D: Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , 'cause Yeah . C: For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . D: No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay . C: Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . C: So you do the looking around at other remote controls . B: Yeah . C: Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . C: And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . A: Right . C: Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . D: So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? D: Yep . D: Okay . C: Uh . D: Mm-hmm . C: And you look at competition and design . B: Yep . C: Cool . D: Okay . A: Okay . C: So we have uh Um . A: Wait for emails ? B: Uh . A: Hmm . C: Okay , groovy . C: And no doubt we'll get um Sorry . D: Oh no , . D: Sorry it's okay . C: We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . D: Okay , cool . C: Okay . C: I shall I can't imagine these are worth much . C: Okay . B: Hmm . C: Fashion into electronic . C: Okay .","summary":"The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function.

{"meeting_id":"ES2005b","dialogue":"C Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . D Okay . D Okay . C So the all in one idea goes out the window . C And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . D Mm-hmm . C So um , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? B Yeah . B Yeah . C Raring to go ? C Okay . C Good stuff . C Mm . B Um . C Oh I need to plug you in . B So how S Sh do you want me to hold it ? D Wow . C Just about . A It's a inspired design . C Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . C Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F_ eight . B So , after that ? B F_ eight . C That's the wee blue one . B f oh sorry F_ eight . C Blue one F_ eight . C Should do it , good one . B Okay . B Yeah . B Yeah . B Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . B Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . C Hold on , sorry . C and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . B Yeah , yeah . B Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry . C Sorry , uh . B Yeah , thank you . B Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? B Then Sorry . C P press F_ five to start it first . B Okay . B Yeah , I can , okay . A Hmm . C Jesus . B Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . B A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . B And what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . B Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . B They are not so good looking . B So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . B And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . B Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . B So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . C Excellent . B Then And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . B Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . B Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . B So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . B So we have to take care of this fact also . B Then . B Uh it was function I want to go to . C Oh you wanna go back ? C Just escape . B Uh , escape , okay thank you . B Then if we look at this slide , uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , like Uh , sorry . C Okay . C Okay . D So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? D Or is are you coming on to that ? B Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . D Okay . D So these percentages are are what ? B Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way . C Okay . B Uh , yes . C Speech recognition . B If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . B So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . D Hmm . C Hmm . B So we should look Yeah . C We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . B We can look at that that factor also , so yes . C Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . D Mm , mm . B Yeah . B So , and And then Yes . C Fifteen to twe Okay . B I think so . B Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . B They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . B So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . B They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . D Mm-hmm . B So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . B So um this is all about uh market potential by me . D Mm-hmm . B Uh , yes , th thank you . C Okay , thank you . C Um , follow on with Helen ? C Yeah please . D Yep , sure , that's cool , um Yeah . B Yeah we have to take that out . C Oh , so we do yeah . B Sorry . C Fun and games . B Sorry . C Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . B Uh sorry , I have . C I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . B Brian , this one also I . B Yeah . C Okay . D I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . B Thank you very much Brian . B If you want me to help , yeah . D Um , yep . B Yeah . D Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? B Uh F_ eight . C Function F_ eight . B Function F_ eight . D Oh right . B Mm s . D Okay , cool . B It's not coming . D Oh . B Function F_ eight , okay . B Yeah . D Yeah . D No signal . C Hmm . B Computer . C There you go . B Computer adjusting , yeah . D Okay . D Cool . D Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? B Yeah . C Uh F_ five . C Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . B Escape . D Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . D Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? C Uh just a left uh left mouse button . D The arrow ? D Okay . D So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . D Um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . C Mm-hmm . C Okay . D So um what they like and what they find fashionable . C Kay . D And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but um maybe that comes up , I don't know . C That can come under Arlo as well . D And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . D That's what people want to do . C Uh . D Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . D I don't know how to get to them , do I press F_ five is it ? C Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . D escape ? D Oh okay , cool . D I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . D These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . C Uh okay . D You know they're grey , they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting at all . C Kay . D Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and I think we can do much better than that . C Mm-hmm . A Of course . D Um hang on . C We hope so . D F_ five , okay , sorry . D Personal preferences . D Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um Uh-huh . C Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . B Yeah . D And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . C Organic . D Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . C Mm-hmm . C Sales , . C Okay . D Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so maybe we forget about that . C Yeah it's like a , yeah . C It's . C Right . C And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . B Yeah . D It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . D And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . C Mm-hmm . B Exactly . B Yeah . C Yeah . D Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . C Okay . C Yeah . D And I think that , yep , that's it . C That's cool . A So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? D Okay ? D Mm-hmm . A Um , or if is that a function we want in the remote ? D Um , I haven't been able to Mm-hmm , yeah or some sort of voice Yeah . C Um , do you have trouble whistling ? A I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . C Really ? C Ooh . A Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? C Yeah , I suppose that's true . C Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? B Yeah . A That's costly though . A Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , uh and then , what would the response be ? D Mm-hmm . C Hmm . B Yeah . C Sounds good . A It beeps back at you or something ? D Yeah , something . A Okay . A Well , uh let me set this up . A So I plug it in , press F_ five ? A Function F_ five ? C Function F_ eight for the um the uh Yeah . A Or function F_ eight ? A Okay . D Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . A Okay . A I think it's uh just to lock it in . A It's got it . D Okay . A Okay . A Um . A So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . C Alright . C Let's remember that . A Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . A Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh he mentioned that they're not fun to use . A And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . C Mm-hmm . C But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . D Mm-hmm . A Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . D Mm-hmm . A Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . A Um . C Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . A Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . D Mm-hmm . A So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . A Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . A And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train . C Ah is that what that is ? A Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . C Well that's cool . C If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . A Right . D Yeah sure . A So , I figured , just put 'em all together . A You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . B Hmm . A Give it one button and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a Right . C Right okay . D Well I like that design . C Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? C Yeah . A So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? C Yeah . A And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? D Yeah , not a problem . A Right . B Fifty million was uh prof As a profit . A Okay . C Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . A Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . A Okay . A Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . D Mm-hmm . A An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um , we don't wanna have it Uh . C Okay . C Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? C Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? D Or a little base station or something , . C Yeah . A Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . A Um , I hadn't thought of that . A Yeah . D That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . C Yeah , yeah . A Right . C I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . D A battery in it , kinda . A Right , so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . D Okay . D Okay . C Okay . A Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . C Okay . A Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . A Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . A And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . D Mm . D Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . B Yeah , me too . A Oh okay . A And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . C Right . D Mm 'kay . C Yeah . A That's all I got . C Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back . A Ooh that's tight . C Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , I'll find it myself , um Ta nah . A Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . A Just push it . B Yeah . C We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . D Mm-hmm . C Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . C Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . D Okay . D Corporate colour . C Yellow . D Okay . A Yellow . C I presume . C Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . D Mm-hmm . C And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . D Yeah . C Uh , where am I ? D Okay . C Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . D Kay . C Uh , now , we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . D Mm-hmm . C We'll use the the basic functions for a television . D Mm-hmm . C No teletext . C Um okay hold on . D Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . C Not enough buttons you mean ? D Yeah . D Well Mm . C So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . D On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . D Mm-hmm , okay . D Okay , cool . C Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . B About cost . B Okay . C Okay um . C So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . A Yeah yeah . C Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . C However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didn't like . D Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . D Mm-hmm . D Yeah . D Yeah . D Okay . C Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? D Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking . B Uh . C Okay . C So Yeah . D Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . B I Uh may I say something about ? C Yeah . B Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . B But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . D Often lost s was that , yeah . C Lost , yeah . D Mm-hmm . B But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . D Mm-hmm . B Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also . C That's cool . D Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C That's cool . C Okay , cool . C Um speech recognition I take it I don't , I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . A Well hmm . A Oh it's They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . A You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . C Really ? A Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . D Mm . C Mm-hmm . A They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . C Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . A Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , but if you can work around that that noise problem Right . D Mm-hmm . C Mm . D Kay . C Uh-huh . D Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . C Ah , that's a good idea . C So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . D If you find if y Yeah . A Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . A What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . D Mm . D Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . A But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker which Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . C Right . C That we should just stick on , yeah . D That comes with our remote control . C Yeah . D Yeah . C And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . A Right , right . D Mm-hmm . A Right , right . A Um . A Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . A If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . A You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . C Uh-huh . A And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . D That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . C Yeah . A Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . C It might do us out of a job . D Yeah , okay . C Um Okay . C I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . C Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so I th yeah and expense and the time . D Mm . A Hmm . D And the expense . D Mm-hmm . C So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . D Mm . C Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . C Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? C Is that Contrast contra well . A Um . D Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . A Mm . A Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . D Mm-hmm . C Yeah , okay . C So if it's dow it's d uh yeah . C Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine . A Right . D Mm-hmm . A Right . C Um Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan . D Yeah , 'cause what I thought , main Slogan , yeah . C Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . D Right . D Mm-hmm . D Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . C Mm-hmm . A Mm-hmm . C Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . D That was more of a a gimmick . C Do you think ? D Mm . C Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . D Yeah , unnecessary . C Okay . D Yeah . C Um , okay so scratch that . C Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? A Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think Yeah . C Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . C Um Mm-hmm . A Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . D Mm . A They're pretty fragile . D So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? C Okay . C Um no , I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . C Um Uh So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . C Um . C So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um Uh you were finding out about teletext . A Yeah mm . C If you could find out that uh Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive , no ? B Yeah . B Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi Yeah . A Oh . D Yeah you think so ? A Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . C Oh right , okay . C Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right , okay . A And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , like a Okay . C Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . D Okay . C Um . C Five minutes . C Okay . C Decisions . C Uh , votes , let's vote . C Who wants T_F_T_ ? C No-one does . C Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? D Mm-hmm , that's cool . C Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . D Um if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . C And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . B Glow in dark . C Uh Uh o okay . A Yeah . C And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . D Mm-hmm . C Okay , so . C Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . C So , it just helps me summarize them . A Yeah yeah . B Here ? B Sure . C And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh Uh pro uh project documents . D And where is it sorry ? C On A_M_I_ scenario controller . A So it should be when you save on your desktop , so it goes save as , or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . D Oh . B Uh it is in shared documents ? C Where am I ? B Projoct uh projector . C Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . A Again . A All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . A Right and then project documents . D Okay , cool . B Hmm . B It is not giving anything . B Shared documents . C And I will tr getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so I did . D Okay . A Mm . A Did you get my email ? A Okay . A Just making sure . D Okay . C So Okay . D What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . D Um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . C Yeah . D The rubber rather than Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A Yeah . C More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . A Wow . B Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . B So , whatever material we use it should be yeah . C Oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money . B So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . C Okay , safety . D Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um I dunno , I mean That's a good idea . C Yeah . C It sme smells good for children . A We could go comp yeah . B Yeah . A We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . A And it's got the thing on the inside . A And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . C That sounds , yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . A And then ch children will love it . D Interesting . A Oh yellow , yellow ball . D Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? A Right . C Please God no . C Um . D No . C Well , I wouldn't th I mean , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it surrounding the logo . D Yeah . B Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . D Having a little bit . D Okay cool . D Mm mm . C Yeah . D Mm-hmm , okay . D Cool . C And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it ? C We put we put fashion into Whoops , it's not working . C Can't believe I've forgotten it . C We put the fashion in electronics . D Oh yeah , that's a good one that . C I bet that'll catch on well . D Yeah so . C Okay , any last worries , queries ? B Yeah . A Twelve thirty . C Okay . C S s I know what you're thinking . B Hmm . C Okay then , lunchtime , yay . B That's good . C Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one . C This is quite fun actually . D Wow . A Mm . D Has anybo oh . C I really don't Yeah , yeah . D Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . D It's pretty cool . A Yep . B Check here . C Wow you've your first page . C I was just writing really big . D Yeah , got small writing . A Yeah I've been using up the pages . D I don't wanna waste it . C I've finished the meeting now . C Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . A Another questionnaire .","summary":"The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design. The Project Manager will ask to what extent the company logo must be incorporated into the design. The remote will feature speech recognition and programmable channel and volume preferences. The number of button functions will be limited to make the remote user-friendly. The remote will have an organic shape and feature some yellow coloring and glow-in-the-dark material. The group seemed to have some minor technical difficulties when opening their presentations.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team, including C, D, B, and A, gathered to discuss the redesign of a remote control for a specific television.

{"meeting_id":"ES2005c","dialogue":"C: Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . C: So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . D: Mm-hmm . C: Um I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . D: Okay . D: Cool . C: Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? D: Mm um . C: N No ? D: No , I don't think so . C: Okay , cool . A: No . C: Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . B: Yeah . B: Hi , me Raj , again . B: Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . B: So we have to look on this . B: First of all methodology . B: The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . B: So what are our findings ? B: In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . B: So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . B: So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . B: So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . D: The last one is the most important one , is it ? B: No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . D: Oh , sorry . D: Okay . D: Okay . B: The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . B: We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . B: So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . B: So that indicates our technological advancement . D: Mm-hmm . B: And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . D: Mm-hmm . B: And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . B: So that they could know how to use these remote controls . B: When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah ? D: Sorry . D: I was just reading fruit and vegetables . D: Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . B: Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming Yeah . D: Okay . D: Yeah . A: We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . D: Yeah . B: So Yeah . D: Th that's very good . A: It's Yeah . B: So something like that we we should do . D: Glow-in-the-dark . D: Okay . B: And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . D: Well , that's good . A: Mm . D: That's what we kind of predicted anyway . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . D: Okay . B: So that should also be taken into consideration . D: Okay . B: So these are my views . D: Okay . D: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? B: So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah . D: Okay . D: Quite disposable . D: Okay . B: Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so So that's all . D: Oh okay . C: Alright , okay . D: Uh-huh . D: Okay . C: Fashion . D: Cool . C: Mm 'kay . C: Fruit and veg , well there you go . C: Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . D: Mm . D: A remote control ? D: Yeah . D: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? B: S uh we didn't find out any such point . D: Or was it just Okay . B: Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so Yeah . C: Mm-mm-mm-mm . D: Cool . C: Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . D: F_ , what is it ? D: Um . C: Function F_ eight . D: yeah . C: Hmm . D: Okay . D: No signal . B: Oh no , . D: Is that ? A: No , it's got it's got it . B: Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . B: Yeah . D: Okay , and then F_ five , right ? C: Excuse me . C: Uh , yeah . D: Okay . D: Um okay , so the interface concept um . D: Yeah . D: The interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , I think . D: Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . D: Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . C: Mm 'kay . D: Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . C: either . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . D: Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . C: Uh okay . D: Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . D: So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . C: Right , okay . C: Yeah . D: And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . D: Do I press Escape F_ five ? C: Excellent . C: Uh no just escape should uh 'Kay . D: Or just Escape , okay . D: Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . D: Yeah , okay . D: So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . A: Wow . D: I'll just walk you through them . D: This one is a voice recognition . D: And that's the kind of idea we're going for . C: Looks pretty complicated . D: There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . C: Right , okay . D: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , which Yeah . C: Mm-hmm , like the middle button . C: Okay . D: Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , like would the computer come Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? C: Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . C: Right , okay . D: But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . D: But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . C: Yeah , presumably . D: I think that's what that is . B: Yeah . D: So these are just a few ideas . D: Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . C: Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . A: Uh it looks threatening . D: Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . A: It looks like yeah . B: Hmm . D: Um this one I thought was really cool . D: It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . D: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . C: Okay . D: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . D: I think something like that would be good . A: Wow . C: Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . D: Of course yellow . D: Right , yeah . C: So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . D: Yeah , that's true . D: Yeah . D: Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . D: And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . D: I don't think that will sell very well . C: Yeah . C: I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? D: I guess so . D: I don't know . D: I think that's a bit Yeah exactly . C: Strange . A: Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . C: No they do , they do . C: They listen to it . A: They do ? C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: And um this one is just pointing out . D: I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . C: Right , okay . D: So that could that's a bit confusing . D: Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . D: They don't have to be all the same . D: So that's quite cool . D: Um . C: Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? D: Yeah , exactly . D: Um F_ five . D: Yes . D: So there are some of the findings . D: So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . C: Brilliant . C: That's handy . D: Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . D: Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . D: It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah . C: Okay . D: So that's quite cool . D: Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah . A: The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh , I think . D: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ? B: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . D: Uh-huh . C: Okay . D: Uh-huh . B: Uh yeah . D: But our budget , we've Yeah . C: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . B: Yeah . B: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . D: Uh-huh . D: Okay . D: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . C: Okay . A: Ben bana Hmm . C: Yeah . C: I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . D: The L_C_D_ . D: Yeah . D: No . C: Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them . D: Yeah . D: S Uh-huh . A: But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? C: Twelve fifty . B: And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa Ah yeah . D: Yeah , that's the thing , because Yeah . C: Possibly . A: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? C: Yeah . A: You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable ? C: Yeah . D: That's true , yeah . D: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . C: Right . D: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . D: Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . C: Yeah . C: Well I mean we could make a Yeah . D: Yeah , I know , carrot . C: Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . A: Okay . A: The the lemon . D: Yeah . A: Well what are the options ? D: But we don't want it to be Yeah . D: Um the child-friendly , yeah . D: Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . D: I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . C: Mm-hmm . D: I think that's a good idea to go for . C: I like I like the colourful buttons as well . D: Yeah . D: And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . C: Yeah . D: Um . C: I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . D: Yeah . D: S yeah . D: So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . C: Yeah . D: Um so there you go . C: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so 'Kay . D: Yeah . A: Oh . D: So that's um the user interface design . D: So okay , I'll take this out now then . A: Okay . A: Um so I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those . D: There you go . C: Yeah , looks like it . D: Mm . C: Uh Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . A: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . A: Right . A: So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget . A: So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . C: Magic man . A: Um this is what they sent me . A: Kay . A: Here's uh the competition , I suppose . A: Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch Right , it's very they're very cheap remote . C: Mm-hmm . C: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? A: This remote costs nothing , you know . A: Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . D: Mm-hmm . C: Right . A: Oh here it is . A: Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . C: Okay . C: So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? C: They gotta be Almost a key-ring . A: Right . A: So this is what we need to have for certain . A: Um . C: Okay . A: So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . A: Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . A: So lots of choices , what do we think ? C: Kay . A: Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . C: Well . D: Mm . A: Organic sponge . C: Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . D: I'm not sure about the sponge . C: Um Yeah . A: Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . D: Yeah . C: And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . D: Yeah . A: Um . A: Yeah so Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex Oh right . C: Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? D: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and Yeah . C: Oh right , okay . C: I don't know what that stuff is . A: So something with give to it . C: Yeah . A: Okay . D: And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . A: And and the colour is yellow , right ? D: Yeah , y yellow incorporated , yeah . C: Or at least incorporating , yeah . A: Yellow , okay . A: Um . C: I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh I don't know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mm-hmm . D: I think Mm . D: Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , I don Yeah . A: Mm' kay . A: So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? C: Um . C: Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . A: So multi-coloured buttons . D: You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . C: Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . D: Makes it easy to use . D: Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . C: I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , a bit comfier , you know . A: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly ? A: Maybe double What about a banana ? D: Like uh an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like a It's not Yeah . C: Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . A: Yeah ? D: We could make novelty remote controls . A: Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , right ? C: Well , yeah , I mean like Yeah , yeah . C: Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . D: Yeah . D: But then how would you point it ? C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . D: How would you point it ? A: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . D: What Yeah . A: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . C: They only cost pennies . B: Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . B: That what our data shows that , so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people uh now Spongy . C: Huh ? D: y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . A: So a spongy banana re Yeah . C: Um . D: Rubber banana . C: I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . D: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Okay , okay . D: I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . D: And what else did you say about fashions ? D: What was trendy ? C: S And sponginess . A: See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . D: And spongy , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Maybe , yeah . C: Huh . D: Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . D: I don't know the name of that . A: So it'd look like this kinda . D: Yeah , that's what I was thinking . A: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? C: Uh . D: Yeah , maybe that's what they are . D: Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah . A: Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . C: Yeah , why the hell not . C: Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros . D: I don't know . D: What do you guy What do you think ? C: Um . C: Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , yeah ? D: No . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . C: Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Exactly . A: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? B: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . D: Uh-huh . C: There's a good man . A: Okay . C: There's a good idea . D: Okay . A: Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . B: Yeah , sure . A: We'll uh Okay , we could do that . B: I will be happy to do that . A: Um . D: Okay . D: And buttons would , did we say ? D: Uh different shapes of buttons ? C: Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . D: Mm . A: Okay , so so buttons . C: They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used . A: Okay , just like that . D: Yeah . C: That's cool . C: I like it . A: Okay . C: Um . A: With the scroll-wheel or no ? D: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? C: Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . A: Okay uh I could put the microphone here . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay there's the microphone . C: Yeah . A: Where should I put the microphone ? C: I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? D: Yeah , I'm not sure . D: Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . C: Glad , we're not doing this for real . D: Um yeah , I can no I'm not sure . A: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? D: I couldn Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 'Kay there's the mic . D: Yeah . C: So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . D: That's cool . A: Um n well we can Whoops . C: Oops . A: Um . C: Um . D: So let's not use the whiteboard any more . A: Yeah . A: Um . C: Upsidaisy . A: Oops , sorry . A: Okay . D: And uh so what else was there ? D: Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? D: Are we just gonna leave that ? C: I s I still like it . C: Um but that's me . D: You still like it . D: Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . A: Right . C: Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . C: I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . D: Cause um it could Yeah . C: Um don't wanna sort of overkill . D: Especially with yellow . D: Mm . D: I dunno . A: Hmm . C: Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? C: Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? D: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? C: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . A: They can work from a You don't have to hold it . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Um . A: I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . A: Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . B: Yeah . C: I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . D: Yeah , do we need buttons ? D: Mm . C: Then it's just apple so sort of Uh , yellow apples though Hmm . A: Yeah . D: I quite like the shape . D: I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . C: Yeah . C: Okay , yeah , that's good . C: Groovy . A: Okay . D: Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . A: But yeah But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . C: Yeah , . A: It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . C: Yeah . D: Okay . C: So I mean like you could actually Yeah , gives you the options . B: Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: So a selection of casings . D: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ? B: In that w S s sorry ? C: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles , yeah . D: You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . B: Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? D: Yeah . B: If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . D: Yeah . B: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . B: It will give apple shape look . D: Okay . B: So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without uh yeah . D: Okay . D: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ? B: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . C: You can standardise those , I mean . D: Oh , that's the other side . B: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side . D: Oh , okay . D: Oh , half a fruit . D: Oh , okay , okay . B: So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . D: Okay , okay . B: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . D: Okay . A: Yeah yeah . C: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . B: And Yeah , . D: Mm mm . C: It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . D: Yeah . C: And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the Maybe . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , um so Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? C: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . A: So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Well , um because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . C: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . D: They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . C: Mm 'kay . C: Mm-hmm . D: I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . C: Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . D: Okay . A: Okay . D: Okay . C: So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour , but have kinda going round , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . A: Mm . D: Because Yeah . C: Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . C: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Uh-huh . A: Mm-hmm . C: W sort of Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . A: Great . A: Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . A: We can use a hand-dynamo . A: Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? A: Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . C: Uh yeah . D: Oh , a d a dynamo ? D: Yeah . D: Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . C: Yeah , I like that , yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah that's quite cool . A: Okay . A: So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . C: Okay . B: But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? C: You shake it and scream at it . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , it is , yeah . B: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah . C: It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . B: Yeah , because most of the people Yeah . C: Then if it's just sitting on the Okay , okay . A: Right . D: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . D: That's true . A: Okay . C: Right um what are the other options ? A: Uh there's solar power . B: Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah . A: Um . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . A: Okay , so probably just Mm . B: Yeah . B: What we w yeah . D: But w like just normal light ? B: I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . C: Oh that's true . B: They can they can recharge it . C: I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . D: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Kay . D: Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing . C: Yeah that kind of thing . B: Yeah , that's Yeah , exactly . A: Okay . A: So uh a rechargeable battery . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Rechargeable . A: Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . D: Mm . C: What's chip on print ? A: Um . C: What's Sorry , never mind . A: Hmm ? A: Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um Oops , this one . A: So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um . A: But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . A: So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . D: Mm-hmm . A: So just in time . C: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . D: Just in time . A: Right , right . C: That's good . C: Uh woah . A: Yeah , and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . C: Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . C: Um we're kind of running out of time , so if you could Uh . C: Was that you ? C: Um that was your bit's covered , I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . A: Huh ? A: Oh yeah that was that was it . B: Uh excuse me , Bri You just touch the pad , yeah . C: Um , yeah . A: So control F_ eight , right ? C: Oh , yeah . D: Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . D: I can't do anything . C: And I just touch the pad . D: No . B: No ? C: It's actually shut down . D: It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . C: Okay , um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . A: Try uh flipping the screen down . A: Kay . A: Oh , I get to do it , too . C: Yeah . D: Cool . C: It's you guys . A: Oh neat . C: Yeah . C: So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , yeah . D: Mm . C: Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . D: Okay . A: Okay . B: That's great . A: Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? C: Uh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . D: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Which doesn't really help me much . D: I think , I've saved mine already . C: Yeah , can you save that uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the Okay . B: Yeah . B: Uh it was under a different name . B: I will show you , in shared documents . B: Uh working components . B: Oh , you didn't get that . C: No . B: I will send new . C: Okay , thank you . B: Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again . C: Um yeah , Project , Project Documents . B: Project documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents . C: Uh right , that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . B: Uh yeah . C: Project Documents is on the um desktop . B: Right , that's great . B: But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password . A: Oh . C: Really ? B: I'll show you . A: Uh these lapel mics are trouble . B: Ts Sorry . C: Oh right , I think um Hold on . B: Uh . C: Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda . C: S Um presumably there's clay somewhere . C: Um . C: Four . B: Yeah , that's great . C: Whoops . C: Light , light , please . C: Light . C: Right , there you go . B: Yeah , th thank you . C: Yeah , quite . C: And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good . B: Oh sorry . A: Are we done with our meeting ? B: Uh excuse me , Brian . C: Um I think we're almost done , yeah . B: You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . A: Yeah . C: Oh oops . C: Sorry man . B: S Hmm . C: Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and Uh . C: Apples . C: Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . C: Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . C: What's supplements ? C: Supplements . C: Uh uh . C: See . D: Cool . D: Fun . C: I shoulda something like that . C: If I kn see I I knew that . C: I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . C: Just for cruelty . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . D: Star fruit . C: I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . B: So sh should Should we leave now , Brian ? D: No . D: Oh yeah , we can do buttons . B: Or we are going to discuss something ? C: Um . C: Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , 'cause I'm confused . D: No I'm good . B: Yeah . C: Huh ? D: Okay . B: Excuse me . C: Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a There we go . D: Mm . B: Sorry . B: Thank you . B: Yeah . C: Warning , finish meeting now . B: So . C: I rounded it up far too fast . C: Um . C: Where are we going ? C: My Documents , that's not what I want . C: My Project Documents . C: There we go .","summary":"The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will build a prototype out of clay for the next meeting. The remote will feature a rubber or latex casing. Several shapes will be designed and shown to the public so that the most popular shape is chosen. The remote will be yellow or partially yellow and have an organic shape. The remote will feature speech recognition. The remote will be powered by rechargeable batteries and come with a recharging stand. The group had difficulty deciding how to incorporate the company's yellow color and the fruit and vegetable trend into the prototype design without the remote seeming overly gimmicky or childish.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, participants gathered to discuss the impact of trends on their market potential, led by Raj who presented findings from a recent remote control market survey. The team delved into the importance of design preferences, technological innovation, and ease of use for their product. They debated incorporating fruit and vegetable shapes, glow-in-the-dark features, and speech recognition technology while considering cost implications.

C: Uh we have budget problems . A: Oh . D: Mm . A: Oh . A: Cutbacks . C: I'm afraid you're all sacked . C: Oops . C: I don't even have this on . A: Hmm . C: Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? A: Okay . B: No , not mine yet . C: No . C: Okay so it's just your your show . A: Oh . A: Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . A: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Sure . A: Okay . D: We made three for you . C: Three ? C: Oh . D: Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st Look . C: Tomato ? C: What tomato ? C: I don't recall a tomato . D: Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . D: So . C: Ah I see , okay . D: Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . C: Mm-hmm . D: The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . C: Logo . C: Okay , brilliant . D: If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition . C: Okay . C: Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . C: Alright , okay . D: Mm I'm not sure about that . D: Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . C: Right . D: Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . C: That's groovy . B: Yeah . B: Uh can I have Oh sorry s Mm-hmm . C: Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . D: Yeah , sure . D: Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate . C: At Oh dear . D: That's that's already got its stand that one . D: That's it stand . C: Alright , okay . D: It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . C: Okay , brilliant mm . D: Um the black on the back is the slogan . C: Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . D: Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that . D: Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . C: Oh right , okay , brilliant . C: Like that from its centre . D: So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . D: These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . D: We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . C: Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . C: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . C: Okay . D: It would have to be a bit bigger . C: Yeah , okay . C: Yeah , scale model , yeah . D: Okay . D: Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . C: Mm-hmm . D: Um and um then the buttons . D: Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . D: Tried to keep it simple . D: Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . D: We used those . D: And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . C: Alright , excellent . D: It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place . C: Okay . C: No . C: It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . C: Excellent . D: So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . A: Oh yeah , yeah . C: Yep . A: This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . C: Okay , so so Barney the banana . A: A a more friendly type of Right , right . A: It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or Yeah . C: Ah excellent , just what we need . D: Yeah . A: Say it for the camera . C: Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . D: Mm-hmm . A: Right , right . C: Cool yeah . C: Well , nice to have uh options at least . D: Yeah . A: Yep . C: Kay and Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . D: So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh . A: It won't stand . A: Just let it lie down , it wont stand . C: Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . C: Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . C: Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . B: Mm . D: Oh . C: So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . A: What's on the uh on the left ? C: There we go . A: Okay . C: Oh god , why is it doing that ? D: Ooh . C: There we go . C: So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . D: Mm-hmm . D: More like a traditional remote control . C: Um . C: Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . C: And by doing so Oh no , hold on . C: Doesn't save us quite as much . C: I don't know what's going on with this again . A: W why is the uh double curved two of them ? C: Oh , good point . B: And double curve on both sides ? C: Um . B: Curve . B: Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? C: That's sort of curve in and out . B: This is double-curve . A: Is i Mm . B: It This one is single curve . B: Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . B: So double-curve . C: No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . D: Like an S_ shape . D: Okay . C: Okay , I might be wrong though . B: Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . C: I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . B: Hmm . B: Hmm . D: Okay . C: A curvature is like the this case . B: Maybe . D: Okay . A: Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . C: Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . A: got two of them Okay . A: Well we can work around that um Cut things out . D: Mm-hmm . C: Right . C: No . A: But you think it should be one . C: It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . A: Okay . C: No maybe the shift button's stuck in . A: Yeah . C: Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us Oh that's fine . B: Mm . B: Should Uh you can do one thing . A: Yeah , so we're We should fire the accountants . C: Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . D: Cool . D: Cool . C: Um We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . D: So we could even add something . C: What ? A: Fire the accountants . A: Ah yeah , we could add things . A: Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . C: Yeah . A: Does that work ? C: Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . A: No mm . C: I don't know . B: You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . B: Then move it with the help of this Okay . C: It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know . B: Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute . B: Okay . B: No input , like this . B: Shift . B: No it's not . C: No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . B: Yeah , it's not working . A: Is it the other shift button maybe ? B: Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? C: No that's fine . C: Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . A: Did you try both shift buttons ? A: It could be the other side . C: Yeah . C: Cancel . C: Piss off . A: That's too bad . C: Oh well , never mind . C: Um . C: Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ? C: Um Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . D: Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . D: Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . C: So Yeah . D: But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . D: Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . C: Yeah yeah . C: Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . C: We have under twelve Euros fifty . C: Project process , how do we think that went ? C: Are we happy ? A: Oh . D: Mm . A: Yeah I think we have a a winning product . C: Okay . C: Evaluation . C: Oh we've been writing this up for m months . D: I think it went quite smoothly . C: Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? D: W I think we were very creative . C: No , I mea I think it means sort of individually . D: Oh right , okay . C: Yes , no , maybe ? D: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Groovy . C: So uh we're just gonna . C: Uh yeah , okay . C: Teamwork ? C: Leadership , sorry . A: Great leadership . D: Excellent leadership . C: Thank you very much . C: You're all get you're all getting a raise . C: Uh teamwork . C: I thought went well . A: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think . C: Yeah . C: Uh and well means , yeah . B: Yeah , we Yeah . C: The technical stuff was brilliant . C: Let's buy more . D: Yeah . C: Uh Right . C: Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . A: These pens are are neat though . B: Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . B: We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . D: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . D: Yeah . C: Mm 'kay . B: At le Yeah . C: Groovy . C: So just general thumbs up for all of us then . B: Hmm . C: That kind of unfortunately is too quick . D: Okay . B: Hmm . A: Okay . D: Well um . C: Uh . C: I suppose yeah . A: Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . C: Um . C: That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . D: Mm . A: Right , right . C: Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . A: Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . C: Whoops . D: Yeah , maybe . B: So So Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? C: Does it go back in , does it ? C: Reusable . A: Something we should get . C: I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying . C: Uh-huh . C: Um I have , yes . B: Uh mine needs also this . C: Huh ? B: At last mine is also the presentation . C: Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . D: Oh , you got a presentation , sorry . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Sorry uh . A: Oh ok Uh . C: It didn't bother to tell me that on this thing . B: S Uh is the project evaluated , that is mine . C: Is it ? C: Okay . C: Doesn't tell me . C: Oh you're doing that . B: Yeah . C: We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . D: Yeah . D: Mm , love to eat that now . A: Anybody Clay covered banana . D: Kind of a green banana now . C: Mm . D: It's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . C: O okay , hold on . D: I've got . A: blue . C: I wonder w which cell do I want . A: It's fun to touch . D: Yeah . B: So . C: Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . B: Yeah . D: Oh could you pass the tomato please . B: So . D: Sorry . D: Thank you . B: So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . D: Mm-hmm . B: How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . B: How mu What rating we will give to these products . B: So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . C: Okay . B: So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . B: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . B: Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? B: Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . D: Mm-hmm . B: So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . B: Then marketing strategy of the company . B: As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s Yeah . D: Sorry . D: Sorry , carry on . B: So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . B: So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . C: Okay . B: I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . D: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . C: Alright , okay . C: The board working again , is it ? B: the user requirem I think . A: Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? D: Um . C: Uh . A: There it is . B: Thank you . B: So . B: So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . D: Mm-hmm . B: First of all uh comes user requirement . B: So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . B: I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? D: Um I think Yeah , it did . D: It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . B: S So what do you think you will personally give . C: Yeah . D: Um so . C: When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . D: Does it work ? D: Yeah . D: So . D: I would say seven . B: Seven . B: Uh . D: Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? D: I can't True or false ? D: No sorry tr one is true . C: One , yeah . B: Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . D: Yeah . B: But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ? C: No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth Oh , I'll go for a one . A: No that's false . B: Okay , right right . D: Okay , so one . B: So it's one for from your point of view . D: Yep . B: And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? A: Uh . A: It's hard to know . A: I I give it a two . B: Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . A: Okay . B: But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? A: Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . A: But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . A: Um I'm gonna give it a two . B: Two . A: Two . B: And what about uh you , Brian ? B: You will go for one . C: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . B: Okay . B: Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . D: Mm yellow . C: Yeah th Come on that was the tha 'Kay . B: And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . D: Uh-huh . B: But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . D: Uh-huh . B: No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . D: Okay . B: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . C: Being fruitist . D: Is that no is that not trends ? B: So . B: Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . D: Mm-hmm . B: Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . D: Mm-hmm . B: So you can what shape a person will like . B: So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . B: And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . D: Uh-huh . D: But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . D: I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . D: We were coming up with one product . B: Uh maybe . B: Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . D: No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to Okay . B: So we can Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . C: He's a tough cookie . B: Three or four ? B: Uh , no sorry , it should be No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . C: Six . C: Five or six . D: What are we doing ? A: What are we doing ? D: Adding them up ? A: We're gonna average them ? B: Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . A: Okay . D: Oh . A: So seven fourths . B: Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . A: About one point f one point eight . B: So we can say one or two . A: Okay . D: Okay . B: because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . C: Oh I see . A: Yeah round it up to two . B: Yeah . D: Okay , yeah . B: So where were the trends . A: So trends . A: Can you explain what you want us to write there ? B: Sorry ? A: How it how conforms to the current trends ? B: Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . D: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . B: Uh . D: Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . D: Tha three or four , I'm not sure . D: Three . B: Okay . D: Go for three . B: Yeah . D: That's fine . B: Uh Okay . A: Kay . A: As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . A: So I give it a a four . A: I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology . D: Mm . C: Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . D: Yeah . C: Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . B: Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . D: Mm-hmm . B: So and in this way our product is good . B: And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . D: Mm-hmm . B: So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . B: And yes . B: It is cus spongy also . B: So they can play with it , it's quite good . B: So then I think , maybe I can give it two . B: So four five ten thirteen thirteen . B: So we can Is it fine ? B: So what about company strategy ? A: Yeah . A: Well it was yellow . D: Um . D: Yeah , the company strategy , okay . D: Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . D: Um I feel I got my say . D: Um so I'd give the company strategy a two . B: Okay . A: Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . D: Okay . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Is that the question ? D: Is it ? D: Okay . A: Um . D: Okay , so one or two . A: Yeah . D: One . D: Okay , just leave it , it's fine . A: I'll go with two . B: So what about you , Brian ? C: Um yeah , a three . C: Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by Cool , groovy . D: Mm . B: Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . B: So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . B: So four six six half . A: So one and a half . D: Yeah , one . B: So we can say two or one Okay . A: A two . B: So th seven seven . B: Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . A: Yep . D: Okay . B: Yeah . B: So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . A: S Okay . C: Cool . B: So we can launch it . B: Yeah . C: Brilliant . D: Woo-hoo . C: In which case we are done . C: Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . D: Cool . B: So yeah . C: Champagne lunch anyone ? D: Yeah . A: Uh . B: Great .","summary":"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product. The remote will come in several designs: two will have different fruit or vegetable shapes, one of which will feature speech recognition in lieu of a large number of buttons. There will also be a child-friendly banana-shaped remote. Both the company name and slogan will appear on the remote. The remotes will be bundled with a yellow charging stand. The devices were made with a latex product with a rubbery texture. It was decided that the product had met enough of the initial project goals to be launched on the market. The Project Manager felt that the group had been too constrained by the budget. Some felt that the banana shape would not appeal to enough of the market and that there was not enough variety in shape in the remotes to make up for this problem.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize their project evaluation, the team, consisting of participants A, B, C, and D, gathered to assess their remote control prototype designs. The meeting began with a demonstration of three prototypes based on fruits like bananas and tomatoes, showcasing features like speech recognition and minimal buttons. However, budget constraints led to discussions on cost-saving measures, resulting in a revised design to reduce production costs to \u20ac11.60. The team engaged in a detailed evaluation process, rating the prototypes based on user requirements, trends, and company strategy. Despite differing opinions, they collectively rated the product a two, indicating readiness for launch. Action items included refining the design to cater to a wider audience and incorporating additional features like an LCD screen. The meeting concluded with a celebratory mood, hinting at a successful project outcome and the possibility of a champagne lunch to mark the occasion.","relevance":0.4893146455,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the three prototypes based on?","answer":"The three prototypes were based on fruits like bananas and tomatoes."},{"question":"How did budget constraints impact the project?","answer":"Budget constraints led to discussions on cost-saving measures, resulting in a revised design to reduce production costs to \u20ac11.60."},{"question":"How did the team rate the prototypes during the evaluation process?","answer":"The team collectively rated the prototypes a two, indicating readiness for launch."},{"question":"What action items were discussed for the remote control prototypes?","answer":"Action items included refining the design to cater to a wider audience, incorporating additional features like an LCD screen, and preparing for a champagne lunch to mark the occasion."}]}
{"meeting_id":"ES2006a","dialogue":"D: .. . C: Okay . C: So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . C: Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . D: Mm , yeah . C: Maybe not . D: I didn't receive it yet . C: Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . C: Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . A: Mm-hmm . C: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . C: Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . C: And then that's it . C: So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five . C: S so any any questions ? A: so sh . C: Is i not at this point . D: Not at this point . C: So this is our project . C: What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . C: Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . C: The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . C: There's the functional design of the the remote control . C: We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . C: Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . C: Um and then the detailed design will come after that . C: We'll pull it all together . A: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? A: Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? C: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . A: Right . A: How how it will be done . A: So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? A: Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? C: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah . A: Okay . C: Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . C: Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . A: Hmm . C: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . B: Why are you looking at me ? C: Would you like to go first ? B: Do I have a choice ? B: Okay . B: Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . C: Oh , yeah , p put them in pockets . B: Right , okay . B: Cool . C: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time . B: Okay . B: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um Okay . C: It's got no eyes . B: Oh , good point . B: Ah , the eyes always ruin it . B: Right . B: Okay , what do it's eyes like ? B: Okay , cool . B: Um this is a rabbit . C: I thought it might be a cat . D: Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . B: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . D: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . C: Yeah I can see by the ears . D: Yeah . B: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . B: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . B: Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . C: Mm . B: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . D: Ah . B: Okay ? C: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? A: Mm . B: I am the um I need my notebook , mm ooh top banana . B: Thank you . B: Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert um so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . C: And more about yourself , you're from ? A: Kay . B: Um I'm from Leicester , um second year . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um what else do you want to know ? B: I like sports um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning um and uh not with rabbits , no no . C: But not with rabbits . A: Mm . B: And vets , I like vets as well . B: And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . B: Okay ? A: Cool . C: Excellent , to match the rabbit . B: Cool . D: Okay . D: Um so my name is Maarika . D: Where's the pen ? D: Okay . C: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off . D: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . D: Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . D: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm . A: Mm . D: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um . A: That's not bad at all . C: Ah it looks like a dog . A: Yep . D: Okay . B: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . B: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . D: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . D: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . C: the other legs are on the other side . D: Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . D: Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . D: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . D: Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . D: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . C: And where where are you from ? D: I'm from Estonia uh , yep . C: Estonia . D: Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? D: Oh , right , my roles , um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . D: Okay , that's it . A: Thank you . A: Okay um I'll do some I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay . A: Kay um my name is Gaurav . A: Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow . A: I've got no idea how to draw a cow . C: Good luck . A: Uh this is going to be Yeah , that'll do . B: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns . A: Okay , so let let me draw the body first . C: Mm . A: Big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face . C: It's eating . B: It looks like Eeyore . A: And there is some grass there . C: Yeah . A: So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way . B: Horns , draw some horns . A: So yeah , I like cows . A: Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . A: Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . A: Um I'm from India . A: Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . A: Yeah . C: Excellent . A: Thank you . D: Thanks . C: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . C: Okay , here's a space . A: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? D: It looks very very cute . C: Yeah , I like the cow . C: I'm Jen . D: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . C: I like Mm . B: Is that a lizard ? A: No way . C: Hmm . D: Wow . C: It's a gecko . D: Ah , a gecko , okay . A: Ah okay . C: Yeah . B: Is there a difference ? D: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah , they are mm-hmm . C: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . C: And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . D: Ah . A: Uh-huh . D: Mm-hmm . D: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? C: I don't like snakes . C: I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes . D: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . C: That's where I'm from , Australia . C: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . A: Mm . D: Wonderful . C: Okay . A: Thank you . C: So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . C: So , I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . B: If you right click on it you can Yeah , I was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . A: Mm-hmm . C: Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . C: We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . C: Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . C: Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . C: And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . C: Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . C: So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . C: Okay . C: Hmm . C: This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , okay . C: We've only got a couple of minutes . C: Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? D: Yep . D: I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . C: Mm-hmm . C: I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . A: Mm-hmm . A: I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . C: Something something new . A: Mm . C: Mm-hmm . B: So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? C: Mm-hmm . B: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . C: Uh-huh . A: Alright . B: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: Okay . C: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or Mm-hmm . B: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? C: Yeah . B: But what do most people do ? B: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . B: Sometimes they play a movie . B: Yeah , so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do Yeah . C: Yeah . C: So , no . A: Yep . C: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . D: Mm-hmm . A: And then use the Mm . B: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . C: Mm-hmm . B: Hmm . C: Excellent . B: Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . C: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . C: Mm-hmm . C: Great . C: Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? A: Mm . A: Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Um Hmm . D: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning , yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . A: A big learning curve , yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a yeah . C: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . D: Hm-hmm . C: Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . C: Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start . A: Alright . B: Mm-hmm . C: Okay ? D: Okay . C: Thanks for that . D: Thank you . C: Uh I'll see you in half an hour . D: See you . C: Carry the laptops back again . A: Hmm . C: Do we need to unplug things ? C: Probably .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda. She explains the project, which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The three components of completing the project will be functional, conceptual, and detailed design. They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name, role, drawing their favorite animal, and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal. After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have. They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional. They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting. The marketing expert will work on user requirements specification. The interface specialist will look at the working design. The industrial designer will work on the technical functions design. They will get specific instructions when they get back to their workspace. They will sell the remotes for twenty five Euros each. They will aim for a profit of fifty million Euros. The remotes will target the international market. The group got the idea of making a menu-based remote that would require very few buttons to operate. Although this is an original idea, one group member points out that may be too innovative and users could have difficulty learning how to operate it. They did not yet come to a decision about whether this idea should be implemented.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off their design project, the team led by Jen, the Project Manager, gathered to introduce themselves and delve into the creation of a new remote control for a television.

{"meeting_id":"ES2006b","dialogue":"C: All hooked up . C: Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . C: Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . C: The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . C: I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . C: Did anyone ? D: No . A: Mm . C: No . C: Oh well . C: Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . C: Um and it should be in there . D: Mm . D: Um um wi on on a what ? D: Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . C: Project documents , yeah . C: So I'll put it in there . D: Oh okay , yeah . C: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? D: Yes , I think so . C: Yep . C: I'll do that next time . C: Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . C: The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . C: Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . C: I just sent at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . D: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . C: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . C: And we've got forty minutes to do that in . C: So I would say yeah ? A: You said uh targ target groups , what does that mean ? C: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah . D: Um Okay . A: Uh okay , 'kay . A: So are Okay . C: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . C: So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . C: Does anyone have a preference for going first ? A: Alright . A: I can go first , yeah . C: You wanna go first ? C: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . D: Hmm . C: I assume we just pull it out ? D: Mm . A: Right . A: Um so f from the Right sure . C: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? C: Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . D: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . A: Uh okay . A: So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . A: So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role . A: Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . C: Hmm . A: Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . A: Okay , so these were the basic findings from today . A: The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . A: Uh I just quickly jotted them down . A: Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . A: Um okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . A: Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . A: And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . A: How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . A: Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . A: Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . A: Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . A: The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . A: So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . A: There is a user interface here . A: So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . A: Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . A: Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . A: This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . A: And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . A: That's about it . A: So anything that you would like to know or No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . C: Okay . D: Thanks . C: Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? C: Br Okay . A: Um yeah . C: Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . A: Anything else ? A: Yeah . A: Certainly , yeah . A: So so tha yeah , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but um unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . C: Yeah . C: That's fine . C: Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? D: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . C: Yeah , I think that will do . A: Yeah , okay . D: Yeah . C: Okay , so do you want to Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? D: Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay , yeah . C: I think that has to come out of there . A: Yeah . A: Mm 'kay . C: Yeah . D: Thanks . C: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . D: Oh i Okay , I hope wait . D: Should it just There's just nothing . A: I it'll take some time . C: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . D: Oh right , right , right , um Okay . D: Nothin okay , something is coming up . A: Oh , there it is , yeah . C: Now it's coming , computer no signal . A: It'll come up , it um uh no signal . D: No signal ? D: Why ? C: Maybe again ? A: Yeah yeah , it says something now , adjusting Okay . D: Oh . D: My my computer went blank now . C: Okay , adjusting . D: Adjusting . D: But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now . C: There we go , there we go . D: This is the problem , but Um . A: Oh , that's strange . C: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . A: Okay . A: And one more time . C: Okay , so one more time . D: Uh now it's okay . D: No ? D: No . C: Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . A: Mm . D: Oh okay . D: Okay , that's fine , that's good . C: Okay . D: Okay , let's start from the beginning . D: So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up . D: Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . C: Mm-hmm . D: Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . D: And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . D: And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . C: Mm-hmm . D: Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . D: And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . D: And and also the volume is very important . D: Um um I als okay . A: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? A: Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , okay , that's great . D: Kay . D: Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . C: Mm-hmm . D: So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . D: And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . D: Um then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . D: But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . D: And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . C: Mm-hmm . D: So at the for the time being that's uh that's all . D: If you have questions Yeah , and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . C: Yeah . C: If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . C: It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? A: So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . A: Um but um so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . A: But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? D: Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? A: Right . D: A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . A: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . A: Right . C: Mm-hmm . D: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . A: Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . C: Mm . A: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . D: Yeah . C: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . D: Mm-hmm . A: So yeah ? C: Mm-hmm . D: Yep . A: Cool . C: Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . B: Cool . C: Do you want to yeah . B: Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? D: Uh am I going in the right direction ? D: No . D: Wait . B: Yeah . D: Okay , here it comes . C: Oh , I'm getting hungry . D: Okay , here you are . B: Cool . B: Ah , that's why it won't meet . B: Okay , cool . C: You set ? B: Yep , cool . B: Okay , functional requirements . C: Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . B: Alright , yeah . C: Hello . A: try to press oh , okay , yep . C: Is it plugged in prop it's working ? B: It's working . C: Okay . C: Excellent . B: Cool , okay . B: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . B: Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . B: What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . B: Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . B: Um okay , so . B: What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . B: Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . B: Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . B: Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . B: Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . B: Um I dunno what zapping is , but Oh , right . C: It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . B: But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . B: Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . A: Mm . A: Right . C: Mm . B: Okay ? B: Cool . B: Um so this is my little graph thing . C: Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . B: Mm k Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . C: If you explain it to us it'll be fine . C: Yeah . B: What it is is um it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . B: Um but ooh where's it go ? C: I liked the , I liked the litt ooh come back . B: Back . B: Oh . C: No . B: Oh yes , cool . B: Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . A: Mm-hmm . B: Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . C: Okay . B: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . C: Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? B: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . B: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . B: Okay , cool . B: So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . B: Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . C: Mm-hmm . B: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , but you know , it's up there . C: The remote control . A: Mm . B: Um that yeah . B: Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . A: Right . C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . B: Yes . B: Okay , cool . B: Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . C: That's alright . B: Um okay , but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . B: So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . B: Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . C: Mm . A: Right . B: Um okay ? B: Cool . B: Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . B: So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . B: Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . B: Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? B: You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . A: Mm . A: Mm . B: Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . B: Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah , that's it , you know . A: Mm . A: Some kind of a ring , some Right . C: Keys and things like that , yeah . C: Whistle and it screams at you , yeah . B: I know , it's weird . B: My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . B: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . C: Mm-hmm . B: So okay ? A: Hmm . B: Cool . B: That's me . C: That's you , excellent . A: Okay , that's great , thanks . D: Um that's very good , very interesting . C: Um . C: I'm just gonna tick yes . C: So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . B: Cat's . B: Ca . A: So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . A: Um . B: Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I'm assuming , you know , yes . A: Right . A: Right . A: Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , yeah . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . A: Right , and Right . B: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? A: Mm . B: So , you know Yeah . C: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , you share a television or something that yeah . C: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry , we unplugged it . A: Right . A: But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? B: Oh , I've unplugged it . B: Do you want me to Yeah . A: Oh , oh , okay . C: Here , let me Yeah . A: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . B: Seventy six point three percent . D: It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? B: Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , you don't normally have a car , yeah , so . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things . A: Alright . C: Kids . A: Yeah . B: You're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than a car , but yeah . C: Yeah . A: So you're more likely to b Yeah . B: Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . C: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . B: No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? C: Yeah . B: You know , I think Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . D: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: But do they But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . B: We didn't have a T_V_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . D: Common , the students yeah , yeah . D: The s the stu yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , it might not even function with the old T_V_ . A: Mm . B: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . C: Mm . A: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? D: Yeah , we're still yeah . C: Yeah . A: So mm uh are are are Mm . D: Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . B: Yeah . B: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . C: Yeah . B: You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Is not a massive difference , you know . D: Yeah . C: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . B: No , do totally . A: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? A: Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? C: Mm-hmm . A: Uh and uh Yeah . B: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? B: Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . C: Yeah . A: But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: I don't know . C: Yeah . C: With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , tha that should be relatively simple . D: An Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Right . B: S so y you'd maybe need a code word . A: Right . A: Okay . A: O Right . B: Do you know what I mean ? C: Mm . B: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . B: I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? C: Yeah . A: Mm . B: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . A: Right . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . C: Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . D: Yeah but uh um Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . D: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . C: Yeah , I think we need both . A: Mm . A: W What uh Mm . C: Yeah . C: Mm . A: What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . A: If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . C: Uh-huh . B: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . C: Uh-huh . A: Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , some kind of Mm-hmm . C: So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . B: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Watch Sky and yeah . B: Yeah , yeah , and that would be really annoying . A: Alright . A: Yeah , that's Right . C: Mm-hmm . C: But that's definitely a possibility . D: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . A: Mm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? C: So that you can yell at it , yeah . B: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . B: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Alright . D: Yeah , but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . B: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah . A: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm . C: Mm . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . D: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . C: Mm-hmm . C: That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . D: Okay . D: Oh yeah , yeah . A: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . D: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm . B: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . C: The l Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . A: Alright , yeah . B: Yeah , definitely , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . C: But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . D: The major ones , yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Right . A: Okay . C: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . C: Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . D: Mm-hmm . C: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . A: So where exactly is this i Ah , okay . C: It should be on your desktop , so on the yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . D: Did you find it ? D: It's just yeah , yeah . A: Yeah , yeah in that one , right yeah . C: Yeah , and email them round . B: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? C: Yeah , that would be great . B: Okay . D: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay . C: Oh yeah , put them in there . C: Yeah , then you don't have to email them . B: There you go . B: But is everyone's called functional requirements ? C: No , they're all called something slightly different . A: No . C: Technical requirements and something something , yeah . B: Okay , so that's good . D: Yeah . B: That's me done . C: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . B: Okay , cool . C: Um as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . A: Right . C: Yeah ? C: Whatever that means . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I guess I'll find out . C: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ? D: Uh something conceptual , yeah . A: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? A: Con components , oh . C: Components , yeah . D: Hmm . D: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . C: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . D: Okay . C: Okay ? C: Right on time . D: Cool . C: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? D: Okay , see you .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control. She pinpoints the main functions of on\/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions. The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable. The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator. They discuss the target group, deciding it should be 15-35 year olds. After they talk about features they might include, the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks. When they return to their desks they will complete a questionaire, do a summary, and send the project manager their powerpoint presentations. The interface specialist will look at the user interface concept. The marketing expert will be watching trends (possibly relating to voice recognition). The industrial designer will look into components The group is interested in voice recognition- this is an option they will have to explore further before deciding whether to use it.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, the team gathered to showcase their individual progress.

{"meeting_id":"ES2006c","dialogue":"C: Excellent . C: So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . C: I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . C: Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . C: Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . A: Right . C: Okay . C: Um , do you wanna start again ? A: Okay . C: Let me we've got forty minutes . A: Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . C: You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um mm , okay , so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . C: Let's hope the pen holds out . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Okay , so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? C: Mm-hmm . A: If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . A: This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . C: Mm-hmm . A: If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh everything else is kind of Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . A: So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . C: Yeah . A: So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Right ? A: So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . A: Okay . A: So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? C: Mm-hmm . A: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ? C: Yeah . A: Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? A: So . A: And dynamos . A: Um yeah , yeah . B: Does that mean like a wind-up one ? A: So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . B: A wind-up remote . C: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . A: So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . B: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . A: Yeah . C: And charging their remote , yeah . B: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just Yay . A: Yeah , it's a good option . D: So what was what was this k ka Okay . A: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . C: Uh yeah . A: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . C: Mm-hmm . C: For a remote , 'cause you Yeah . A: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . A: Environment friendly . A: Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . C: Yeah . A: There are different cases that can be provided . A: They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: These are the three options , right ? A: Um Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? D: Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , mm-hmm . D: Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . B: Did you say wool ? A: Wo wo wood . C: Wood , wood . B: Wood . A: Yeah . B: Oh right . C: A fluffy remote . A: Not wool . B: Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . A: Oh really ? A: Okay . C: Huh . A: Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . A: If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . C: Mm . A: For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah ? A: Uh okay , the interface options now . A: So we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . A: Ooh . A: Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah , yeah , something like that . B: Sony . C: Mm-hmm . B: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . B: Mm . A: So , and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . C: Okay . A: The scroll plus push . A: So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um in the last decade , so not too recent . A: And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . A: So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . C: Mm-hmm . A: The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? A: The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced . C: Mm-hmm . A: And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . A: Right ? A: Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . A: So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . A: Yeah , on . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . C: Mm-hmm . A: So , these are the different options that we have . A: Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Excellent . C: Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up . D: Okay . A: Yeah , yeah , sure . A: Sure . A: Yeah . C: What are you , PowerPoint , or Okay . D: Okay . D: Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah . A: Right . D: Oh . C: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? D: Kay . C: Some sort of radiation ? B: No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in . C: Yeah . D: Okay . B: S a Ugly . A: Yeah , it should should do it . A: Yeah . C: Right , interface concept . D: Okay . D: Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . C: That's fine . D: So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . C: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . D: So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . D: So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . C: Mm-hmm . D: Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . D: Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . C: Mm-hmm . D: So some findings um um . D: So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . D: Um okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . D: Okay , some of them are here . D: Um well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , sorry for that . D: S go back . A: That's nice one . D: Ah , no , please . D: Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . D: Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . D: And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . C: Mm . D: Um okay . D: So let's carry on with this . D: Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . D: Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait , no this is not the one . D: Okay , there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . C: It's yeah . D: Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . D: And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be . C: Yeah . D: Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . C: Uh-huh , hi yeah . D: So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . A: Mm . A: Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? A: Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? A: Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . C: It's like the like you said , no ? C: The scroll scroll wheel . B: Yeah , you can't Oh , it's like the iPod . D: No no , the scroll button is a different thing . D: I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you . D: I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . D: Look , this one here . D: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or Uh-huh . B: G yeah , no , you can . A: Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh Alright , right . B: It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah . C: Uh-huh . A: Okay , okay . A: So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah . B: It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast . C: Mm-hmm . A: Uh-huh . C: Mm-hmm . B: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . C: Mm-hmm . A: Right . B: Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Right . A: So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s um plus spinning . D: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Uh Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: It it has to be small , simple . D: Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . D: Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . D: There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: So yeah , that's uh that's it . C: Excellent . C: Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . A: Right . B: Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah . C: The project documents . C: Excellent . C: If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . A: Mm-hmm . B: Cool . C: Here it comes . C: Okay . B: Fabulous . B: Okay , cool . B: Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . C: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . B: Right . B: Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . C: Okay . B: So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . A: So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? B: So Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , yeah , sure . C: Yeah . A: Right . A: So mm uh so it yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? C: That's over on the interface , if if you could put Yeah . A: Um and an yeah . C: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing . A: Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . A: W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . B: Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? B: I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . A: Mm . C: Mm . B: And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . A: Right . B: But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . A: Right . C: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something Yeah . B: You know ? B: Yeah . A: That's true , yeah , that's also Right . B: And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah . C: Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . B: But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . C: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . C: Yeah . B: So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , yeah . A: Mm right . C: And then you can flip it open . A: Okay . A: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and Right . C: Yeah , I think so . B: Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . C: Yeah . A: You you agree ? A: Maarika , yeah ? D: Yep , yeah . A: Yeah . C: Right . A: So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . B: Okay ? A: Go on . B: Cool . B: Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . B: Sorry , I discovered clip art . B: Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . B: So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . B: Do you know ? B: Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . C: Yeah , and possibly even uneven , like not not symmet yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: You know ? B: Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . B: But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . C: Mm-hmm . A: Right . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . B: Um Yeah , but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . C: Something a bit squishy and Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . A: Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah , w energy source . D: So it could be like a rubbery yeah , uh-huh . B: Yeah , yeah . C: To some degree . C: Uh-huh . C: Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . B: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down . C: From from bouncing it . A: Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . C: You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . B: Yeah . B: Um so yeah , um okay . A: Mm . A: So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Mm yeah . A: Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . A: Um Yeah . B: You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . B: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? C: Uh-huh . A: It uh Mm . B: No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . B: I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . C: Mm . B: Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? C: Yeah , 'cause the Yeah . A: Uh I think uh Right . A: Right . C: Dunno . A: Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . B: Yeah . A: Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . A: It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . C: Nothing to open them . B: Yeah . B: Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . A: Right , yeah , yeah . B: But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . A: Right . A: Okay . B: Okay , cool . C: Anything else ? C: What've we got ? B: Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . C: Okay , so . A: Cool , thanks . B: Okay ? D: Thanks Yeah uh-hum yeah . C: Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . A: Yeah . A: Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah , so um hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? C: Yeah , rub off some of those . A: You you got a wind dynamo , yeah . C: Yeah , it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up . A: Okay . A: Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh it's Yeah . C: I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs . B: It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? B: You know ? A: As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . B: I mean if I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . A: Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . C: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . A: Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , yeah . C: I'd I'd keep it on . A: Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? C: We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable . A: It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . D: Yeah it's yeah . A: Um okay , we still have all all the options . A: Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? D: N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and The wood thing . A: Mm . A: Right . C: Mm . D: Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah . A: Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's it's much more uh Right . C: Mm . D: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah . D: Yeah . D: U yeah wood is not really yeah . B: Well it's not very cleanable either , do you know . A: That's true . D: Yeah . B: It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . A: Yeah . B: And splinters and stuff and It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . A: Yeah , okay wood is out . C: Yeah . A: Right . D: Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . C: Yeah . A: Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . C: Yeah . A: Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be Mm right . B: You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? D: Yeah , but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? C: Mm-hmm . B: G yeah , yeah . D: Yeah , so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming . A: Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . C: Just for fast Yeah . A: Right . A: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . A: Mm right . D: Yeah . C: And it yeah L_ L_C_D_ . A: So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . A: Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? A: Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? D: No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . A: The numbers . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? A: Right . D: Um Yeah , I would say buttons , because it's yeah . A: Or on the L_C_D_ we can , you know Okay . B: G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah . C: Buttons . B: It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . D: I Yeah . A: So mm Alright . C: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Right . A: Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um Uh okay . C: I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , so if we put down the key um things that we want . A: Okay , okay , so the components . D: Yeah . A: Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? D: Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah , about the spinning wheel . D: So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah , yeah , in that case . B: E either or G yeah . C: Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . B: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . C: Yeah . B: But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . C: Hmm . A: Mm um I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . C: But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . D: Ah , but I mean you can Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , rubber buttons , but then Yeah . B: Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . C: Th that would be on one side , uh-huh . A: Uh i it Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . C: No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . B: You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . A: Mm-hmm . B: Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . A: Right , right . C: Mm . A: Right , okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . A: Um Right . B: Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? D: Mm-hmm . C: That's right , that's what they're after . B: Yeah . A: So I'll rub that out . A: And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or Mm . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or Yeah , does Yeah . C: I guess . B: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . C: Bananas . D: Banana's yellow , yeah , definitely . B: Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? B: So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . C: Mm-hmm . C: Green . C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . A: Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . C: We need the advanced yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: So I'll rub off the other two . C: Mm-hmm . B: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber . C: That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . A: Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah . A: Yeah . A: So I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . B: Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . C: Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . D: And the buttons as well , I think . D: Yeah . C: We've got five more minutes . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah . C: Yeah , mm-hmm . B: It's just a gimmick . A: Okay . A: Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? C: Mm-hmm . A: It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so Ye yeah , we we don't have too much information about it , um Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . C: Yeah . C: I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , but if it's Yeah . D: Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah . C: It's from the company , so Yeah . C: Okay . A: Right . C: And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . A: Flat on the top . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? B: Yeah , sure j Sorry , do you want me to What does um I_C_S_ mean ? C: Just so we can Nothing , it's right , I'm just There we go . A: I_C_s ? A: Uh integrated circuits . B: Okay , cool . B: So it's advanced integrated circuits ? A: Yeah . C: Uh oh now I've gone too far . A: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: We're on our way . C: Okay . C: So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . A: Right . A: Yep . C: We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . C: That's our overall concept , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours . D: Um Uh-huh . D: So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer Okay . C: I think it's on the Mm-mm . B: Imagine it would be inside . B: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . A: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , okay . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , yeah . C: Yeah . C: On the Mm-hmm . C: In the centre , yeah , sure . D: Mm yeah . C: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . C: In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . A: Mm-hmm . C: Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . C: And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . D: Mm-hmm . A: Cool . C: Is that all okay ? C: And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , okay . D: Mm-hmm . B: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own . C: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . B: I know , I'm hated . C: Unplug yourself . D: Hmm . B: I've got a bit tangled up in all this .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The industrial designer begins presenting, first describing the insides of a remote control. He lists the options for types of batteries, shapes for the remote case, materials to use, and functions to include such as push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require. The interface specialist begins presenting, first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes. She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance, and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel. The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends. She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular, meaning curviness and assymetry are in. The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style. They discuss what material should be used, talk about how the surface of the case should look, and plan out the general user interface. After they make some decisions about the remote, the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting. The Industrial Designer will work on look and feel. The Interface Specialist will work on user interface. The Marketing Expert will work on the product evaluation. The two designers will work together on developing a prototype using modeling glay and follow the instructions the group has come up. They will get extra instructions from their personal coach The remote control and its buttons will be made of rubber. The case will be flat on top and curved on the bottom. The remote will have push buttons outside, and an LCD and spinning wheel inside. The remote will resemble a vegetable and be in bright vegetable colors. It will have voice recognition, use a simple battery, and contain an advanced chip. It will have standard on\/off, channel-changing, numerical, and volume buttons, with a menu on the screen. *NA*.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, C outlined the agenda focusing on presentations and decision-making regarding key remote control concepts.

{"meeting_id":"ES2006d","dialogue":"A: I'm proud of it . C: Okay . C: This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . C: And again I'll take minutes . C: The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . D: Yeah . C: Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . B: It does look very cool . C: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . C: Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . C: Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . C: So we've got forty minutes . B: And then do we get to make a remote control ? C: S 'Cause we missed out . B: Yeah . C: So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . A: Uh-huh . C: Is that right ? A: How how much do we have , forty minutes ? D: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . C: Yeah , until about four fifteen . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So yeah . A: Okay , so . C: Go for it . C: Do you want Yes . D: So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . A: Presentation . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . A: Um Yeah . B: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? B: It's a bit um phallic . A: Um Yeah . C: Dual use , perfect . C: Dual use , perfect . B: Oh , your remote control ? B: Oh that's just bad . C: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? C: Sorry , sorry . A: Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . C: Mm-hmm . A: So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . A: And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . C: Mm-hmm . A: And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . C: Wow . A: Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . A: Yeah , yeah . D: Uh yeah . C: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that Mm-hmm . D: Rubber . A: Oh yeah . A: Yeah , it has , yeah . D: Yeah , . B: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? D: Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . A: I I think it's it's uh Yeah . D: Yeah . B: It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Hmm . D: And it's spongy as well . B: I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . D: So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . C: Huh . C: Mm-hmm . D: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . C: Yeah . D: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . C: Six seven eight nine . C: I like that . D: Yeah . D: And then , well this is on off button . D: It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . C: Yeah . D: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . C: Uh-huh . D: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . B: So where's the volume ? C: Yeah . D: The volume is is scrolling . D: On the side , this one . A: It's on the side . B: Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm . D: Yeah you just do it like this . D: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . B: Oh okay , . C: Mm-hmm . D: See ? D: So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . C: Mm-hmm . B: Cool . B: Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . D: A mute button . A: Uh no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . B: Yeah . D: Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . C: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you . B: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . A: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . D: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? C: But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? B: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? A: Mm . D: Okay , yeah , okay . B: Okay , cool . B: So that that solves the whole mute issue . A: Mm . D: Yeah . D: And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . D: You can't really see it in the interface . C: no . A: Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . D: Yeah . D: And we do have the logo on it as well . C: Mm-hmm , very good . D: So I think it Yeah . C: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . D: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . A: Cool . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: We ran out of resources here , so . D: In the actual one . D: Yeah . D: So if you have questions . A: You can have a look . C: Very good , let's have a look . C: Test it out . C: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . B: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . B: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . B: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . B: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . C: Very good . B: Mm-hmm . C: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . B: Okay . A: Yeah , see the budget . C: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way . B: Wales . C: Wales , for example . B: Mm . B: Cool , okay . B: Right , okay . B: Fabulous , yeah . C: Marketing Expert . B: Okay , cool . B: So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . B: Um , you know . B: Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . B: Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . D: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: Okay ? B: Cool , so these are what they are . B: Oh Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . C: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . C: Is that right ? C: Mm dots , never mind . B: Okay . B: But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . A: I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . D: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . C: Yeah , I agree . D: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . B: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? D: Yeah . C: Yeah , just prepare one now . D: Shall I just prepare it now ? B: Yeah . D: It will be red , too . B: Cool . B: Okay . B: So , be attractive to look at . B: That's this one . B: What do you all say ? A: So ? C: I reckon it Yeah . D: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? B: Yeah . D: I I go for seven . C: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . B: Oh we're all so proud of the . A: Yes . C: Yeah . B: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . B: Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . B: Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . C: Ah , okay . A: Okay . C: Excellent . C: Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . B: Yeah . B: But that's alright . A: But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . B: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . B: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? C: Yeah . B: Cool , okay . B: Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? D: I would think yes , yeah . C: I think it does . B: Yeah . B: I mean Yeah . D: Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . C: Alright . C: But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . A: But then yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable . B: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . D: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue . C: Yeah . A: Right . D: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Yep . B: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . A: Mm . B: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? C: Um Six . B: What do you what do you all think ? A: Mm . C: Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um They Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . B: Okay . D: No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . A: So Yeah yeah yeah , I mean yeah . D: So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: So you guys can decide wh whether Oops . B: Yeah . B: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . D: Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . A: Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . C: The length is gonna be difficu Mm . D: It's a little bit long . B: Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? D: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . A: Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . B: Because So you have to keep that side flat . D: S uh slightly smaller . D: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . A: Okay . B: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . A: Right . B: Okay . A: Okay . B: Um okay , so C_ . B: Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? C: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . A: No , we have a locator . B: There's a locator . B: Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? D: Mm that you stick on T_V_ . C: Mm . B: To make it beep . D: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . A: Yeah . B: Or a buzzer . C: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Yeah . B: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . B: It's locatable ? D: Yep . B: Fabulous . B: D_ . A: Intuitive , completely intuitive . D: Yeah . D: If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah . C: Yeah . C: I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . C: I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . B: Yeah . A: Intuitive . B: Yeah , and I mean d So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . C: So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . A: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . A: Yeah . A: So l Yeah , okay . C: Five ? C: Yeah . B: So we give that one a five , you think ? C: I'm happy with five ? B: Yep . A: I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I'm glad you're accepting this . B: It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? B: Um intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . B: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? A: Mm . B: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . B: Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . B: Investigate . C: Yep . C: But otherwise it's superb . B: So , should we give it a six ? C: Six . B: Six ? D: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . D: See . D: Yeah , so it's kinda Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Well we've banned them from Yeah . A: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . B: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . A: Mm yeah . A: And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . C: Yeah , it's varied . C: Yeah . B: Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . C: Six ? B: Okay , F_ . D: Yeah , it does have yeah . C: Voice control have seven . A: Absolutely . B: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? B: That's just Oh okay , cool . C: Ah , that's the second one . C: So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . B: Um right , so . A: So it has voice control . B: Yes , so that's a seven then . A: Yep . B: Um , cool . C: G_ technologically innovative . A: Anyway it ha yeah , it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . D: Technologi well Yeah . C: But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . D: Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . C: All of the components have been used in other things before . D: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . A: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . C: But do yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . C: What do you reckon , five , six ? B: Yeah , what do you all think ? D: Six . B: Six ? A: Yeah . D: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? B: Well , that's it , I mean Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? D: It still has to do what i what it has to do . C: Yeah . B: So , I don't think many peop That's it , they can take it with them . C: Space remote . C: Put fashion in electronics . A: Absolutely . D: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? D: Yeah , sure . A: The carrot banana remote . D: It's the maximum fashion . B: So , we give it seven , and we write There we go . D: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . D: So I think we've done very well , but What's the assessment ? A: I think that's a . B: Cool . C: Very good . A: Yeah . B: So , we need the average here , so we got Seven So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen . D: The average is about six and something . C: Yeah , one . D: A little bit over six . C: Or a seven . A: There are how many sixes ? D: No , wait , a little bit under six . A: One , two , three . D: No , wait . A: Three . A: And one five . D: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . C: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . A: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . D: Four sevens . A: Forty six and five , fifty one . C: Six point point about six point five . A: Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . D: Six point something , yeah . B: Two three four Seven eight . D: Six point five , yeah . C: Close enough . B: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . C: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . C: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? B: Um no , that's it , yeah . C: That's it ? C: Alright . C: So , finance . C: And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . B: Cool , there we go . C: Sorry , this is I'm just um Beautiful . B: There we go and there are the marks . D: Yeah . C: Not anymore . C: Computer no signal ? C: Adjusting . C: There we go . C: Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . C: And now we have to calculate the production costs . C: So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . C: Can you read that ? C: Almost . C: More or less . C: Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . C: No hand dynamo , right ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: One simple battery . A: Mm . C: No kinetic energy , no solar . C: The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . A: Advanced , yeah . C: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . D: Yep . C: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . D: Yeah , yes . C: Case material we said rubber . D: Rubber . A: Yep . C: I don't know what special colour means . A: Mm anything uh I think which is not more . D: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . D: So I think this is probably special co no ? C: It could be Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . A: Yeah . B: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? B: You know . D: Yeah . D: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , yeah yeah , okay . C: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . C: We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? D: We have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as well . A: Mm . C: S for the muting . D: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . A: No uh we we have uh yeah . C: Yeah . D: And we have L_C_ display and yeah . C: And button supplements . D: Um Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah . A: Mm no . B: No . A: We don't have we're not using any of that . C: No . C: No ? C: But the the spinning wheel's not there . C: I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? D: Okay , let's yeah . B: We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ? C: I think the pushbutton oh . B: Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? C: I don't know if that's one Yeah . B: Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . C: That seems unlikely . C: Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense . A: Huh ? A: Wh wh what is the limit ? A: Uh . B: Twelve point five . D: We have to count all of them , or yeah . A: Mm I don't think so , no . B: No . B: Well it doesn't , but it uh And L_C_ display . A: No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . C: No . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . A: Wh wh what's our criteria ? B: This sample sensor . C: Our budget's twelve point five . A: Uh okay . B: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . C: Yeah , so that has implications though for the . A: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . A: when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . B: Yeah . C: For the locator . B: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? C: Yeah . A: Mm and the locator also goes away . B: We can afford to get rid of it . D: But it was very no innovative innovativeness . C: Yeah . B: So that means no locator , does it ? D: Well um yeah . B: I mean does Yeah . C: What else does it need ? D: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . C: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . D: This would be Yeah , yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , okay , so we Uh-huh . A: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . A: Uh I mean uh um yeah . B: Okay , yeah . C: Right , so we need one fifty off . A: Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? B: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down . C: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . C: We could do Yeah . A: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? A: But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . D: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . C: You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . D: Mm-hmm . B: So that's point three . A: No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . D: But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . D: If you Mm . B: Yeah , I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . B: That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? B: Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah . C: That's with the L_C_ We decided , 'cause it's not on our list . A: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? B: Yeah . A: Oh so so the the this is . C: The scroll wheel is on the side . A: So we're adding costs for right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . D: So Mm-hmm . B: S so we're point three over . C: We're point three over at the moment . C: It's nothing n Yeah , I have Yeah . B: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . B: Could b still put them on the side . B: But yeah . B: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but Yeah . A: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . B: Yeah . A: On the side . A: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . D: Okay , yeah . C: Rather than having three different things that people have to do . D: Okay . C: There we go . C: Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . B: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? C: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . B: Yeah , but Yeah . C: So that's alright . C: We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah . A: We have , yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Excellent . C: Alright . C: So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? B: No . B: No , I don't think so . A: Not really , no . A: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . C: Mm . B: Yeah . A: We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . C: Yeah . B: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . C: Yeah . A: Um yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Alright then . A: But we lose the locator . B: Really ? C: We're gonna have a beep . D: Well we're going to have a beeping thing . A: So instead of speaker , . D: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Kay . B: Cool . B: That's not a very exciting colour . B: I think you should make it more vegetable-like . D: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well . C: Tha . B: Oh the the beeper thing . B: It Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . D: It can come in the same colour as the the case . C: Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh . B: You know , your pen vibrates ? C: Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . B: Yeah . C: But only for a very short time . C: Um okay . C: So looks like we've designed a banana . C: Well done , team . C: Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . B: Cool . C: Feedback ? A: I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . C: Ideas ? D: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . D: The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . C: Yeah . A: So , had we known Yeah , that or not , yeah . B: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . A: So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . B: Yeah . A: Mm . C: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . A: Yeah , mm . B: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . C: Mm-hmm . B: It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . C: Mm-hmm . C: Banana . D: Yeah . B: Um yeah , so yeah . D: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . C: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . D: And the pens . B: Uh I like the pens . C: We like the pens . B: I want one . B: That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s I don't think you should say that was the recording . C: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . A: Yeah yeah yeah , that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs . D: Yeah , yeah . C: They great ? C: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? C: Oh okay . B: Okay , cover up the microphone . B: Alright , let's take it . C: Yep . C: Shh . C: Yep . B: Okay . C: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep . B: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah . B: Yeah . B: The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . B: Not that you can do that on the board , either . B: We could make some little Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . D: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . C: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Mm yeah . B: back it , this is just had to be changed . B: And yeah , so cool . C: Yeah . B: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? C: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . D: Yeah . D: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . C: I have no stake in it . B: Yeah , definitely . A: Yeah . B: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . C: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . D: Mm-hmm . C: I'll leave the room and you can have another go . B: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . C: Better than that than the banana . D: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . C: I think it worked quite well . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? D: To express them mm mm no . A: Mm . A: I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: New ideas found . C: Not quite sure what about . D: Well it's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah . B: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Hmm . B: Yeah . B: I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . C: Yeah , that's right . B: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . D: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . B: Yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . D: Patent patent patent . C: Banana remote . B: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out . D: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . B: That vibrates Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . C: Flip . C: Vibrate . C: And uh yeah . C: Nothing that you really want . C: True . C: Yeah . C: Okay . C: So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ? D: Yes . B: Yes . C: One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . C: Um we've evaluated the project . D: Yes . C: You've got the scores . B: And it's fabulous . C: Can you put that in the project documents file ? B: It's in the project documents . C: It's in there already . C: And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . C: Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? D: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . C: Yeah . D: Otherwise it's it's all fine . B: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . A: Mm-hmm . A: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . D: Yeah . C: Okay then . C: Um I think we're still well within our time . B: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . C: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . D: Yeah . C: We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . A: We certainly are , mm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yes . C: So I would say that's the end of that meeting . D: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . C: Thank you , team . B: Kay . C: It was very productive day and Mm uh no . A: Yeah , same here . B: We could draw animals on the board again . A: Mm uh no . A: I don't think so . D: You can make some animals . B: I don't like Play-Doh , no . D: Oh , you don't like anim It doesn't ? B: It's just minging . B: It smells so bad . B: It does . D: Smells quite nice . D: Smells very sweet . B: Mm . C: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . A: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? C: I don't know if it's already sent or not . B: No , it hasn't been . C: Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here , really . B: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? B: Okay , so the other way . C: Did I save this one ? C: Production costs . D: I made your animal for you . C: It was supposed to be pink . C: But it was blue on the board .","summary":"The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete. The team needs to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary. The remote will be black\/yellow color and the shape of a banana. Remote flips open on side. LCD and push buttons inside flip-open door. The LCD will display the main menu, which offers various options. Has an on\/off button, channel flipping, volume scroller on side. Corporate logo will be in grey. Remote uses one simple battery and an advanced chip. Single-curved surface. Rubber case material. Locator will have a beep instead of a speaker. When rating the product on how well it matches the user's behavior, they found that the product is more convenient for right-handed people and less so for those who are left-handed. When rating whether the product is intuitive, the layout is different,a good technology but less standard. It could be more difficult to get used to. The team had to cut out some features in order to make the budget. This happened because they had not known beforehand the cost of such features.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize their detailed design meeting, the team gathered to review the prototype presentation and evaluation criteria.

A: um I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . D: Very nice . A: If you're all ready . C: Yeah . A: So is the agenda ? A: Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . A: Project aim is a new remote control . A: It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . D: Kay . A: Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . A: Tool training . A: Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . D: Okay . A: Um . A: Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ? B: Okay . B: So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm . A: Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ? D: Clip . A: Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . B: Yeah . B: okay . B: So my favourite animal 'Kay um Um okay , it's big , it's got a great memory . A: Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? D: Ah . A: Is it rude ? D: It's an elephant . A: That's a very good elephant . C: The back end of an elephant . D: Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . A: Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . D: Does it ? D: Oh . B: Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . A: Mm . D: Mm . B: And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . A: Okay . B: Nice animal . A: Wonderful , well done . A: Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? B: Okay . A: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? C: Aesthetic yep , sure . D: I have no idea what my favourite animal is . C: Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see . D: Oh . D: It's A what ? C: Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . C: It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . A: No . D: Alright . C: Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? D: How . A: No . B: No . D: No . C: Oh it's a hilarious movie . C: You have to see it . C: And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . C: But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . A: Okay , well done . D: Great . D: Me ? A: Yeah . A: Miss mar Miss Marketing ? D: Okay . D: Not quite sure how this is gonna work . C: There go . D: Cool . D: Uh well I'll try my best to draw . D: Can I just draw the face ? A: Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . D: Ooh . D: It's a cat . A: That's a very pr pretty cat . D: Which also has what ? D: A big fat body and big and a long tail . A: Okay , do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ? D: Why ? D: Because um cuddly . D: And usually cats are very friendly . D: Usually . D: And they're healing as well . D: They heal . D: And they can feel when a human's got problems so So , that's why I like cats . A: Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . A: Well done . D: There we are , that's me . A: Okay . D: Mm . A: Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little Uh . D: Mm-hmm . A: I honestly can't draw for toffee . A: Uh . B: Really ? B: Oh that's a Not bad I would say . A: Yeah . A: no no uh That's exactly what it is . C: A prairie dog ? C: Oh a squirrel ? A: Uh not a very good one Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . C: Yeah , that's pretty good . B: Very good . D: Ah . C: Alright . A: Right . A: Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . A: Mm . A: Let's move on to the next page . A: Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . D: Market range internationally sold . A: Yeah . A: Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . D: Ah right okay . A: experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . A: Any ideas ? A: Stuff like that . A: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . A: At quarter to twelve . C: So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . C: I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . C: Uh S Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . D: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Yeah . A: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but Okay . C: Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . A: Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? A: Pretty much everybody . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , I think we've all got Mm . D: Uh . A: Um . B: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? D: Yeah . D: Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . B: Okay . A: Kay um . D: Well . B: T But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? D: A new remote control for T_V_ . D: What would I like ? A: W what You want it big do you want it small . D: Um . D: Medium . A: Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . C: Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . A: Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . C: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . D: Mm . D: Twelve fifty . B: Twelve fifty . C: It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . D: Each . A: Per unit , yeah . C: Cost . B: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . A: Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . D: Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? B: Yeah . B: Right . A: So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . C: Yeah . A: Um . D: Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . B: Yeah . D: I mean remote controls can be thin bits . D: And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . A: Kay . D: have slides . D: And then it all comes compact into one . A: Okay , that's . D: So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . A: Th that's an idea . C: Yeah . D: So you just flip them out . A: Okay . B: Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . B: I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . A: One side for kids , one side for adults . B: Yeah . C: I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . B: Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . B: No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but Start breaking up . C: Oh . C: Oh okay . A: Like it or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . C: Yeah . C: Okay . D: That would be cool . D: I was thinking that like a flip . A: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um , oh we've got five minutes left . D: Okay . A: But okay . D: Um . A: Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . C: Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . C: Okay . C: Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate D_V_D_ players , things like that . A: Yeah . A: I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . C: Yeah . A: We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . B: Yeah . C: Okay . C: Right . A: What do you reckon ? C: Yeah , I mean . A: See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . C: Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , certain certain demographic Yeah , no I think you're right . A: I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . A: Yeah . A: May w you know , maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah . D: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? D: I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Or just one that looks really fucking cool . B: Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . C: Yeah , rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah . A: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah . B: Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm . C: Yeah . A: I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's Yeah . C: Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . D: Mm . A: Yeah , that's right . A: Yeah . A: I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen . D: I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . D: So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . A: Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . D: Yeah . D: But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . D: So make it Yeah . A: Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . D: Mm . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Okay . D: And even for kids as well . D: It's um it's safer for them , I guess . D: Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . A: No porn channel for children . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um Let's move on . C: I guess that's good good for now . D: Mm . A: Oops , let's close that . A: Next meeting , uh okay . D: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? A: Industrial Designer um which is Um . D: Ah ri okay . D: these are requirement specification . B: That's Mm . D: And I'm marketing . A: Yeah , there you go . A: So User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . C: That's me . C: Okay . C: Right . C: Right . A: Um . A: Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . B: Mm . B: Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap , because Yeah . A: And in marketing User requirements specifications . D: These are requirement specification . D: So what the user requires in a remote . A: Yeah , what Right , okay , yeah . C: Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . D: I guess that's what it says . A: You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . C: Yeah . A: You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . D: Mm . A: Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . A: Okay . A: Okay everyone , well done . A: Good meeting . C: Alright , see you in thirty minutes . A: Yeah . D: So , do we take these off ?","summary":"The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals.

B: Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? C: Think we all Huh . B: You will as well ? C: Oh I thought we all were . C: Yeah , I have one too , okay . B: Okay . C: S Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay . B: Yep . A: Right . A: I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . B: Okay I'm Okay . A: just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . C: Yeah . C: Sure , that's a good idea . A: So Okay , and Gabriel . B: I'm Catherine with a C_ . B: C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . C: Uh Gabriel . A: E_L_ is it ? C: E_L_ . A: Kay . A: And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ Okay . D: I am Reissa . D: R_E_I_S_S_A_ . D: Double S_ A_ , yeah yeah . D: Sorry . A: S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . B: Right . B: True . A: Uh , right . D: Mm 'kay . A: Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . A: Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . A: I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . A: Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . A: But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . A: So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . D: Mm . A: Um . A: Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . A: We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . A: Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . B: How long is the meeting ? A: This meeting it's not very long . A: It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . B: Okay . A: So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . B: No problem . A: Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . A: If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . A: Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . A: Cause I don't . A: Uh okay . A: So um . A: You okay over there ? A: Reissa , are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? D: I'm fine . D: Yeah . D: I uh yeah , yeah . C: Think she's finishing up her presentation . D: D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . D: No no . D: Uh I'm done . D: Okay . A: Okay , jolly good . A: Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . A: I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . D: Mm . A: So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . B: Okay . B: Okay . B: Um just connecting this . B: Are we getting i Really ? A: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . B: Okay . B: Cool . B: Okay . B: So I've got a very quick uh Uh . B: Okay . B: So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've oh no , you can't see a thing . B: Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . B: It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . C: Oh . B: We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . A: Ah . B: So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . B: So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . A: Mm-hmm . B: Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . B: And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . B: So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . A: Mm-hmm . B: And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . B: Um and that's it really for the working design . A: Great . A: Okay . B: Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but Really ? A: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . B: Cool . A: Yeah . B: Um , should I erase this or Okay . A: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . A: Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? B: Fine . B: Or suggestions ? D: Is a battery like the only way of No , no No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . B: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s In indoors . C: Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or Bicycle power . A: Yeah , you blow on it and i Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know . D: The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ? B: I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but Yeah . D: Mm . D: Yeah . C: One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? C: I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . A: How far away is your television ? A: It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ? C: Uh That's true . B: Well , the thing is uh you you don't Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . A: Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . D: Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . B: I didn't think about that but Why not ? D: How about Bluetooth ? D: Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . D: Isn't that a better signal ? B: I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . A: Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . D: Mm . A: You know we don't need it . B: It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna But Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't Do you need the border ? A: Yeah , exactly . A: Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . A: We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . A: It's uh Okay . D: Mm . D: S just an idea . A: Right , well done , Catherine . A: Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . C: Okay . C: Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . B: Okay . B: Sorry . C: Technical . C: Okay . D: Adjusting . C: Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh . D: Yeah . C: So I'm doing the user interface design . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . C: Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . C: we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . A: Mm yeah . C: Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . C: Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . C: Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . A: Okay . C: And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you uh . C: Yeah . C: So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . A: Mm-hmm . C: Uh and this is a user centred one . C: Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . A: Yeah . A: Great . C: And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . C: Um . C: So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . C: Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . D: Mm . A: Yeah . C: So uh , yeah , that's me . A: Great . A: Okay . A: Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . A: This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . A: Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah . C: No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . C: I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . C: That was sort of the inspiration for it . C: Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . A: Yeah . C: I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . C: I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? A: Um I would say it's If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Kay . C: Right . A: Look into . A: Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . A: It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . C: Mm . A: You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . C: Right . D: Mm . A: Um . C: And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . A: We put the fashion in electronics . D: Mm . C: I think I think we have to carry that mental . A: There you go . A: So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . A: If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . C: Mm . D: Mm . C: Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . A: Yeah . A: Because we need Yeah . C: I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . C: Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . A: Great . A: Okay , fantastic . C: Um . A: Right , well done , Gabriel . D: Okay . A: Um Reissa . D: Where does it go into ? A: Let's plug you in , baby . D: Here ? C: Yeah . D: The blue thing . C: Uh , yeah , this is getting all . C: Mm . C: Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . D: Well , function F_ eight . D: No oh . A: Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . C: Yeah , it just takes a second uh . D: Come on . D: Right . D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . D: Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . D: So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . D: Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . D: Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . D: So I think we all agree with that . D: Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . D: So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . D: Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . A: Cause we've only got five channels . D: exactly . D: That's another thing . D: Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . D: Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . A: I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . C: Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm . D: Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . D: I think especially for uh the older generation . D: I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . D: Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . C: Mm . D: So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . D: Um personal preferences . A: Wow . A: You are a child of technology , aren't you ? D: Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . D: Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . D: And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating . D: So voice activation . D: So and this was what we came up with . D: Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . D: So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . A: So there you go , yeah . D: Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . D: And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . A: Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? C: No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . A: They they don't . A: It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . D: Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so So they don't Well These guys are growing up . A: For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . A: Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . C: Yeah , that would be my guess as well . A: Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . C: What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? C: I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . A: Yeah . C: I mean , okay , there's Uh . D: Voice activation might not be the best . A: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . D: Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense Huh ? C: Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm . D: Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . D: I don't think so . B: Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . A: So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . D: Yeah maybe not so hard . C: Mm . B: Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep . D: Yeah . A: Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . D: Maybe Mm . C: Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . A: Yeah . A: They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . D: Yeah . A: I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . C: Yeah . C: I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . A: Yeah . D: Mm . D: Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . C: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Okay . D: So that is me . A: That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . A: Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . A: It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . D: Mm . A: It's gotta be cheap . A: S um . D: Mm . A: Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . A: I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . A: Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . A: Um . A: But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . A: So I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . A: Um anyone have any questions ? D: Mm . A: Everybody happy in their work ? C: Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . A: Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . A: We all know where we're going to . A: Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? C: Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . D: Well , just questionnaires . A: Yeah . C: Sell trying to sell your things . A: Yeah , stuff . A: Um okay . A: Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? D: Yeah , you can . A: Right . C: Okay . A: Do all you all know my e-mail address ? C: No I don't . D: I think he's participant one , aren't you ? B: Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . C: I Uh Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . B: So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . C: Yeah . A: Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? C: Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . B: You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . A: Send me , yeah yeah , okay . B: You want to have friends , don't you ? C: So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . A: Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? A: I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit Okay . C: Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . C: Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves . A: Well , maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? B: It wouldn't be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and If . C: Mm . D: Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ? A: Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . C: Mm . A: It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . D: But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it . C: Mm . A: There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . C: Mm . D: Whoa . A: This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . C: And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . A: Yeah . D: So we have to have it one colour . A: Well , not necessarily . C: Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . A: But we have to incorporate it . D: Mm . A: Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . D: Mm . A: It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Quite poss yeah . A: Well this is all your department . A: Mm okay . A: Well , well done everybody . A: And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . C: Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . D: Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? A: We might possibly have done . B: Cool . C: Alright , see you all soon . A: If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . D: Kay uh . A: Yeah , there you go . A: Right . A: I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .","summary":"The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda.

{"meeting_id":"ES2007c","dialogue":"D: Oh right okay . D: I cover myself up . A: I feel like Madonna with one of these on . A: I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . D: I've always wanted one of these , I really have . D: Where do you buy 'em from ? D: They're . A: Right . A: Hello everybody . C: Hello . A: Back again for another wonderful meeting . A: Is uh everyone ready ? C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Almost . A: Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . D: Oh my gosh . A: I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . C: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . B: Mm 'kay . A: Are you ready ? A: Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . A: Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . A: Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . A: Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . C: Hmm . C: Do you have any preference uh of order ? A: Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . A: I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first . D: Batteries . C: I think she is still finishing her . B: No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . C: Hmm . B: Okay . B: Where is that thing ? C: Okay , it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something . D: It's here . B: Oh sorry , couldn't see . B: Would that work ? A: Get yourself in position . D: Ah . B: Okay , so that's me again . B: Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . A: I don't think any of us remember the fifties . B: It wouldn't be very fancy . B: You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . B: So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . D: Mm . B: Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but Yeah . C: Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . A: Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? D: Mm . B: I dunno actually . A: Does anybody know ? C: Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . B: I dunno . B: Um . B: Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . A: Okay . D: Mm . B: And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . B: So we've got to discuss that . A: Mm . A: Okay , jolly good . B: For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . B: You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . A: What's a double curved one ? B: So Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . A: Okay . B: And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . B: And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . B: But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . B: And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh Yeah . A: So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah . C: Let's have a squeezable remote . B: Yeah . B: And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno So rubber would be Okay . A: when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , I like that idea . D: Mm . D: I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more People . A: Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? A: You think you can market that ? B: Uh s so if d okay . A: Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . B: And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . B: Um scroll buttons , as well . A: Uh-huh . B: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . B: So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . B: Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . B: So it's a constraint . A: Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel ? B: Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? B: If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . B: If that makes sense . B: Yeah . C: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? C: Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? B: No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . A: rubble double double . A: I'll have a Big Mac , please . B: And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . B: So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . B: And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . C: Okay . B: So , either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . A: Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . C: Okay . C: Go rubber . C: Go rubber the whole way . B: Let's go crazy . B: And then , do I have a last slide ? B: Yes , I do . B: Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . A: Yeah . B: Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . B: Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . B: If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . A: Simple , yeah . A: Chip on print . A: It's a bit . A: Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: The infra-red . B: Yeah . A: Right . A: Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? A: Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? B: Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . B: It's less expensive mm Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . A: so it sounds So , why would we not go for that ? A: If it's something that's inside the the unit . B: Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . A: I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . B: Totally . B: Yeah . A: Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works , you know . B: So let's not go for the Yeah , yeah . B: I agree . A: So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . B: So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . A: Yeah . A: S yeah , push buttons . D: What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? C: I think push-buttons is Yeah . A: What about what ? D: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . B: Well It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . A: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? D: Mm , I dunno . D: Be cool . D: Channel two . B: But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and Hm . A: S Yeah . C: Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . A: It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . C: Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . C: So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . A: Yeah . C: But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . C: It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . D: Oh , it just gives an answer . C: So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? D: Oh , then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Just if you are really lonely , maybe . C: Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . B: Channel five . B: And then it switches on . D: Like you talk to it . D: Can I have channel five ? A: Yeah . C: It it's just a remote that talks to you . C: Uh . D: Oh , then forget about it . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Oh right okay . C: I mean to certain cues . A: Yeah . B: Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . B: So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option . C: Kay . C: Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . A: Basic battery . D: Mm . A: It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . C: Hmm . B: Are you happy with that ? D: Mm . D: Yeah . B: Okay . B: So we'll go for the battery . B: Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? A: We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? C: Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . A: The the The double whopper , please . D: So it will look like something like this . B: Double ? B: Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ? A: Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons . C: So rubber rubber keys , yeah . A: Yeah . A: And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . B: P Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So that's another marketing point that we can use . D: Well the rubber push-buttons . D: Don't you have to move your Mm . A: But anything is gonna have buttons . A: Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . B: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't . A: You You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . A: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . B: Mm . A: It's not actually what you are doing . A: But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah . D: Mm . D: Yeah , the rubber's good . C: Yeah . C: We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . D: Yeah , so they can sit there and go like Mm . C: Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . A: And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . C: Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . B: Alright , that's me done . C: Alright . A: Okay , Gabriel . A: Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . C: Alright . C: Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . A: Great . B: Sorry . C: Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . C: And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . C: It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . C: Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . A: Mm . C: Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . C: So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . C: I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . C: It's it's pointless . A: Mm . C: Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . C: It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . C: Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . A: Mm . C: Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . A: Yeah . D: Mm . D: That does get annoying . C: Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . A: Mm-hmm . C: But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . C: Uh um So , the key layout and design are really crucial . A: Yeah . C: You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . C: And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department . C: So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh it's sort of confusing for the user . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . A: Do we have an uh example of a good one ? D: Uh-huh . A: Brilliant . D: Well Maybe we can Right . C: And for something for kids . C: Yeah . C: Um . A: Yeah . C: And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . C: Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . C: I think it should be more general . A: Mm-hmm . C: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . C: And , yeah , that's it for me . A: Okay . A: Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? A: The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . C: So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . C: So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . C: Um . C: I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Uh . C: And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . A: Yeah . C: I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . A: Okay , and we're not yeah . C: Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . A: Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Okey-dokey . A: Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . A: Let's move over to Yeah , sure . C: I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . C: I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . C: But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . A: Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . C: So that should be simple . A: Cool . D: Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year . A: Mm yeah . D: Um . D: So yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um the most important aspect is look and feel . D: So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . D: So it has to be Yep . A: Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? D: Exactly . C: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . D: So Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . A: What's that mean ? D: It should work . C: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . D: Should That's new . A: Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . D: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Yeah . C: If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . C: And it's it's not technologically innovative either . D: So , no loose That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . A: Maybe we could um Of course , they do . C: Mm . D: Well , they do , but it's like it's not Yeah , but it looks good . A: One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . D: If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . A: Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? C: So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ? D: But like You could always insert , yeah . A: Yeah , what I don't understand what m Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television . C: Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ? D: Yeah , but , I mean , people like Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . A: It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ? B: Well Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . A: That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . B: Things like that . A: No , that would be your telephone in with your television . C: Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean Mm . B: No i No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to I with the television , yeah . A: Yeah , and i Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . B: I was just trying to find an advantage . B: Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . D: Well , it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . A: An and there is no there is no such thing . D: Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . A: Okay . D: If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . B: It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . A: Okay . A: Yeah , this that's that's very good . D: And then you can market it . D: Never have to change a battery again . B: Change the batteries ever again . A: And and this is all tying in very nicely . A: The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . A: Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . B: Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . C: Yes , so can Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . D: I think , safety s Yeah . A: But yeah , by the squeezing it the Yeah , that's a great idea . A: Well done . D: Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . D: And I think we've all um worked that out . C: we're all about that . D: Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . D: Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . D: So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , and things . C: Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Rubber things . A: I wanna watch the pineapple channel . D: Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is yeah , so we're in . A: Well spongy , that's where . A: Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . C: Yeah , that's great for us . D: Yeah . D: And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . D: So yeah . A: Okay . D: I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm . C: Right . A: Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , that's great . B: Yep . C: Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . B: No vegetables . D: Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . D: Some sort . C: Uh-huh . D: Or Mm . C: The power button could be like a big apple or something . B: Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . A: Yeah , this is true . C: They don they don't own all images of apples . B: sued the Beatles so Yeah . C: Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . A: Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . A: Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? D: Well I think , if it's rubber it needs to be different . A: I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . D: I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? D: You know like really different colours basically . A: L keep it clean , keep it clean . D: Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? D: Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . C: Yeah . D: Bright natural colours , nothing too Bright , but too not yeah . A: Bright , but not too bright . C: Yeah . D: Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . D: Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah . A: Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? C: Mm . D: And on the back of it have the logo . A: Okay , what ? C: Sure . B: Why not ? A: Okay . C: The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . A: Tha Yeah , I mean we that's we we Yeah . A: This is the remote control tomato . C: I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? D: Well I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . D: Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . D: And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . A: Yeah . D: Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and Yeah . D: The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but Yeah . A: Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . D: So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . B: I'm gonna write that down . D: Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . A: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the Mm . D: Yeah . B: That's yeah . C: Mm . D: So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? D: and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . D: So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . D: So they also get to pick . D: Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . C: Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . D: It's um Yeah . D: Mm . D: D you've got the Evaluation . B: Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . C: Right . A: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . B: Mm . C: Yeah . B: And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . A: Mm . A: Okay . A: Alright . A: Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . B: Yep . A: Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . A: Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . A: You won't be going off to your separate offices . B: Alright . C: Okay . A: Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . C: Oh right . A: I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . B: Mm . A: Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . B: Cool . C: Yeah . A: We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . B: It is . C: That sounds good . A: Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . A: Um . A: And I will be uh talking to the bosses , basically , and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really . B: Great . A: Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . A: Um . A: Yeah , that's This is this is uh good . A: So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . A: We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . C: Mm . A: It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . A: Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . D: Mm . A: People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . D: Yeah . A: Um . A: you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? A: We'll look into this lock key facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . C: Right . A: Okay . A: I think that's um well done everybody . C: Alright . A: Anyone have any uh any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? C: Yeah . A: Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . C: Yeah . C: Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . D: S This gives you all the details ? A: Okay . C: Okay . A: right well . A: It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . A: But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire . C: Okay , I'll stay in here . D: um . A: Um . C: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company . A: Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . A: Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . C: So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . A: I want a share in the space rocket . A: Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . A: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Yeah . C: Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . C: Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . A: Yeah . C: I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . D: Mm . C: R_R_ . C: Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . A: Mm . B: That's true . A: And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one . C: No . C: Mm . B: Doesn't Yeah . A: Okay . A: Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . A: Uh . C: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Right , well , I guess that's us . A: Yeah . A: It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . A: So maybe you should go back to your own offices . C: Okay . C: Right . B: Are we taking these off ? A: Yeah .","summary":"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries.

The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote. The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design. The interface specialist will work on the user interface design. The industrial designer and the interface specialist will work on a prototype. The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation The remote will have rubber push buttons. The case will be made of rubber. The remote will not use a chip on print. The remote will use a kinetic battery. The case will be double curved. There will be no display physically featured on the remote itself. Whether to have a sample sensor in the remote. What color the remote should be. Whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in the remote. How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to discuss the progress on designing a TV remote control.

{"meeting_id":"ES2007d","dialogue":"D: It's Play-Doh . A: Play-Doh's edible . A: Did you know that ? A: It's definitely Yeah . D: Because kids yeah . B: I used to eat it . C: I've , I've definitely eaten it before . C: I didn't know was edible . D: But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah . A: It's it's chew proof . D: It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then Well , normal babies . A: Yeah . C: Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . A: Yeah . D: Oh yeah it is , yeah . D: Oh yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Right . A: Everybody everybody ready ? C: Yeah . B: Yep . A: Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ? C: We've got some . B: We've got a cool prototype . C: Yeah , it's pretty exciting . C: So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . B: Double curved . A: Nice . C: So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . D: That is cool . C: So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . D: What's the big blue thing ? C: That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . D: Oh cool . C: And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . A: what button ? A: Um . D: And mute . A: Oh mute . A: Okay . C: So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . A: That certainly does . C: So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . A: Mm . C: So you don't you Yeah . B: Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . A: Mm . C: It should be . C: And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . C: I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know change that . A: Yeah . A: S great . D: Oh it's so cute . C: So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . A: I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . B: Oh right , yeah . A: But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . C: Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . A: Yeah . A: They make left-handed scissors , you know . D: Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? C: Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , . A: Yes s Mm . B: Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . A: Sure . A: Sure . D: Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . C: Uh-huh . D: I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah , it's not Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Imagine d are you right handed ? A: Yeah . B: Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah . D: Have them in stock . A: Yeah . D: Make 'em more appealing as well . A: But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . C: Do you think it says R_R_ ? B: I think it does . A: I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . C: Fashion to electronics . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . C: Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . A: Yeah . B: There you go . A: Yeah . C: So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah . A: Yeah , very good , yeah . A: It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . A: Well done . D: And all the playing around is uh Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? A: Um before we move on I need that cable . D: Okay . A: Thank you . A: Yeah . A: Um . A: One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . C: The costs , was that what you said ? B: Play-Doh is very cheap . A: Well , yeah . D: Mm . D: Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . A: um Yeah . C: But it's edible . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Chew proof . D: Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . C: That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . A: Uh right . A: Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . D: Yeah . B: Oh ho-ho . B: Yep . A: And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . A: Ooh . A: So the case , we've gone for the double curved . A: Um and it's made out of rubber . A: The interface is push-buttons . A: And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? D: Yeah . A: So special colours . C: Yeah . D: It's better for And special material . A: Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . C: Yeah , I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so The buttons are rubber . A: Yep . A: Yeah . A: Um . A: Are they made out of any special material ? B: Rubber . A: No they're not . A: They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple Okay . D: Well they're rubber , aren't they ? B: Yeah . A: Right . A: So let's see if that comes within budget . A: And it does . A: That is gonna cost uh Yeah . D: We're under budget . A: That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . A: And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . C: That's cool . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: So , this is all very very good . C: And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . A: The bosses will be very pleased . A: Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . A: Uh . A: Save it in save it in the uh my documents . D: It's already saved , I think . A: Splendid . A: Okay . A: So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . A: Gonna do what you were gonna do , your evaluation . D: Thank you . D: Mm . D: Oh , yeah . D: This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . D: Right . D: Oh . D: S function Okay . A: F_ eight . A: I love the smell of that Play-Doh . D: Mm . C: Yeah , have some have some . A: I cou . D: Okay . D: So , evaluation . D: We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . D: I've got the criterias . D: And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . D: And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box . D: And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . D: So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . D: So the first criteria . D: Do you all get what we're doing ? C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay , cool . D: Okay , first criteria , look and feel . D: So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? D: As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? D: So what mark should we give for that ? C: Mm . A: I would give it a seven . C: Yeah . D: As in it's not . C: Oh , sorry , one . A: Oh sorry , one , d yeah . B: A one . D: A one a one . D: So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . D: Second criteria , new technology . D: Have we implemented new technology ? D: As in the new high-tech So it's . B: Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . D: So we'll give it a Yeah . B: Well so the um Yeah . C: It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . A: Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: True . A: So on the technical side of it it Easy to use . D: I'd say it's about a a twoish ? C: It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno . B: Two . D: Two . D: Three . B: Yeah . C: Maybe three , yeah . D: three . D: So criteria three is is it easy to use ? D: I think it's a one , I think . A: I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . C: Yeah . A: I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but Yeah . C: Mm . D: Two , so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? C: Okay . B: Mm . C: If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Give it a t give it a two . D: Yeah , okay . D: Kay , criteria four is costs . A: Cost . A: It's come in under budget . D: s great . C: Yeah . A: So that's a definite one . C: That was great . D: Yeah . A: Amount of buttons . D: Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one ? A: Contains only the necessary buttons . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Um criteria six . D: R_S_I_ is it good against ? D: Yes . B: Yes s yeah . A: So it's anti-R_S_I_ . D: Very good . D: It's one . D: And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? D: Is it easy to get lost ? B: It's yellow . A: I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . C: It is very bright , yeah . D: No ? D: But it is smallish . C: It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . B: Two . C: Maybe it will . C: Uh . B: T Mm . D: Mm . D: I think i it would , could be , could get lost . C: You think it could lost Mm . D: Mm . A: two . D: Yeah . D: I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely . A: I mean it No , I mean I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but Okay . C: Okay . C: Yeah , anything , I mean . C: Okay . C: It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . D: Yeah . C: But , yeah , it can get lost . D: The mobiles get lost all the time . C: Yeah . C: Okay , yeah , two is fine . D: But then you ring 'em and you find them . C: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm . D: So Yeah . D: So , that's that . D: So that's the evaluation , so I'd say Yay . A: Alright it's all all systems go . D: It's like like a number one . B: We've , we've done well . C: Yeah . D: Um . D: Number one product . C: Mm . D: All done , thanks . A: We can't fail . D: We fitted all the criterias . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , so So that's that one . A: Well done , Reissa . A: Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . A: You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . A: That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team . A: Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? B: Well . B: You know It is . A: Fantastic . C: Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , . D: been cool . A: I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . D: In four diff in in four meetings . A: Yeah . D: Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . A: You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get Yeah . C: Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . D: They're using our ideas . A: Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . A: Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . A: But um No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . C: So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? C: We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? D: Yeah . B: Y Oh really ? A: Or six , uh I haven't got message . D: Just start summarising now . D: You can reply to the same message . D: See summary , there . D: If you just reply to that one . C: So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . C: It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember . D: Was it was it fifty or five ? C: But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? A: It gets handed over to another department . D: Depends how much we sell . C: Uh . A: What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . C: Hmm . A: the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . A: When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . C: But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing . A: Um . A: Yeah , that's it . A: You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . D: We finished an hour earlier . A: It's new , it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already . C: I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . D: Mm . C: We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse . D: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . D: Definitely . A: Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . C: Mm . C: Mm . C: Mm . C: It make watching T_V_ healthy . A: Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . D: Yeah . A: It's fine , it's kid proof . D: Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . C: Uh . A: Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . D: No . A: Yeah . A: So all in all , I think we've done very well . B: Mm yep . A: Well done everybody . D: Yay . C: Right , you too . A: Um . A: Drinks are on the company . B: Cool . A: In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . C: Mm . B: Glad to hear that . A: Yeah . A: That's it . C: That's it . A: Well , as far as I t as far as I know . A: Um . D: Yep . D: We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . A: No . A: Anyone wanna play I spy ? D: Mm mm . C: I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . C: Should we call the day then ? A: Yeah , I guess . A: I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . C: Uh , right . A: Um . A: It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . C: Mm-hmm . D: In project . A: But I'm not the authority to say that it is . A: Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? A: The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? D: I love it . D: I love it . D: I think it's cool . D: Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool . D: Being watched . D: Um Wow . C: Your moment to shine . A: Yeah . A: I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . A: something that t the whiteboard thingy , that's great . B: Yeah . A: Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . A: I mean it's i or in such a new idea . A: It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . B: Yeah . D: Mm . C: Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Logitech . C: I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . D: Yeah . C: So . C: Shall we Right . D: Meeting adjourned . A: Yeah .","summary":"The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we re happy with their product and their performance in the project. *NA* *NA*. The need for separate right-handed and left-handed remotes.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize the innovative remote control design project, the team, consisting of A, B, C, and D, gathered to review the prototype presentation. The remote was designed to be ergonomic, made of rubber, and feature unique double-curved buttons for easy use. They discussed the functionality of each button and addressed the need for both left-handed and right-handed versions. The team agreed on the design's comfort and innovation, ensuring it met the criteria for anti-RSI functionality.

{"meeting_id":"ES2008a","dialogue":"D: Hmm . A: Okay . A: Good morning everybody . A: Um I'm glad you could all come . A: I'm really excited to start this team . A: Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . A: My name is Rose Lindgren . A: I I'll be the Project Manager . A: Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . A: And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . A: First of all our project aim . A: Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . A: I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . A: Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . A: First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . A: So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . A: Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . A: So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . A: Um Alima , sorry , Alima . B: Alima . A: Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . A: Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . B: Okay . B: Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . A: Probably both . B: Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . B: I have no drawing skills whatsoever . B: But uh let's see , introduce myself . B: My name is Alima Bucciantini . B: Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . B: I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . A: How do you spell your name ? B: A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . A: Thanks . B: Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . B: So let's see if I can get um here . B: I will draw a little turtle for you all . B: Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . B: And you have the pretty little shell going on . B: Some little eyes . B: Happy . B: There you go . B: That's a turtle . D: Yes . A: So what are your favourite characteristics ? B: Um . B: I I like the whole having a shell thing . A: Mm . B: It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw . A: Excellent . A: Shall we just go around the table ? C: Uh Okay . C: Well , my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . A: Mm . C: Um . C: And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . C: I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off . B: No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright . A: Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . C: Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . C: Is that at least identifiable ? B: Snake . D: Well . C: It's a whale , yes . A: Em Mm 'kay . B: Well , snake ? B: It's w Oh , a cat . C: Thanks . D: Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . C: Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . C: And I just find them interesting animals . D: Take my contraptions with me . D: Alright , I'm Jessy . D: I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . D: And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . D: Don't really know how to draw this . D: Just where can I Mm . D: Mm . D: Maybe if I do the water , but how ? D: Sort of give an idea . D: I have no idea how one would explain this . D: Mm maybe with some whiskers . D: Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . D: You can imagine it in the water . D: I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . D: Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . A: Mm 'kay ? A: I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , from California . A: Um . A: Hmm . A: S Um it's actually a coyote . D: It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . B: Yeah . A: Let's see . B: Right . A: Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . D: That's impressive . B: That's That's pretty impressive . A: Yeah . C: Cool . A: Oh dear . A: Yes . A: I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . A: We have coyotes howl all the time . A: So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . A: Mm . A: Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . A: We're gonna talk about project finances . A: Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . A: Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . A: So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . A: Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so Hmm . D: Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . D: Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . D: I just wanna watch the T_V_ um . D: Always gets lost . D: Some sort of like device to help you find it . C: I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . C: You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . A: Mm . C: So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . C: Um . C: I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . C: Um . C: And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . B: Yeah um . B: I agree with having too many remotes around . B: My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . B: What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . B: And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . A: Mm-hmm . B: So I know . D: What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? A: Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . B: Yeah , something that doesn't Mm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um . A: Um . A: Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . A: So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . A: So how do we work with that ? C: Mm . B: Yeah . B: Could we get something that just has No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , channel changing . A: Mm-hmm . D: And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . B: Yeah . A: Mm . B: N that way Yeah . A: Mm . B: Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . B: Um . A: Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . B: Yeah . B: Mm . A: So like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . C: Yeah . B: Right . A: Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . C: Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? A: Good question . A: I don't know that yet . C: Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? B: Mm . A: It's a good question . A: Um . D: Mm-hmm hmm . A: I'll look into that . A: If I can . D: I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . B: Mm yeah . D: You know , things might be more advanced than that . A: Mm . C: So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . C: Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not . B: Yes . B: I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . B: If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . C: Yeah . D: It's an idea with the buttons being really . B: Large . D: Yeah . B: If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . A: Mind if we move on ? A: Ps mm okay . C: Kay . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . A: I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . B: Hmm . A: Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . B: Yeah . A: Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . A: Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . A: Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm 'kay um . A: And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . A: I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . A: Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . A: Any questions ? C: What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? C: Do we know that ? A: I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . A: I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . C: Right . C: Yep . A: So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . B: Kay . C: Yep . B: I'm sure we'll be busy . C: Okay . A: Um just including all the things that we talked about . C: Can you e-mail your slides as well ? A: Um . C: Is that possible ? A: Yes , I yes , I think I can . A: Mm-hmm . C: Cool . A: I'll just attach it to an email . A: And you're you're number two , three , four ? B: I'm two . D: I'm four . A: Is that correct ? A: Okay . B: Alright . A: Excellent . A: It was lovely meeting you all . A: Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . B: Kay . A: Let me see if I can do that right now .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced herself to the team. The project manager introduced the upcoming project in which the team is to create a remote control. The team members participated in a tool training exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal on the white-board and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager then talked about the project finances and discussed selling prices, profit aim, market range, and production costs. The project manager then led the team in a discussion on their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to include in the remote they are producing. The team members discussed the option of combining remotes and how to produce a remote which is capable of controlling multiple devices. The project manager will investigate whether the team is to create a remote that is to be sued solely with televisions. The industrial designer will work on the working design. The user interface designer will work on technical functions. The project manager will type up the minutes of the current meeting and e-mail those to the team members. The project manager will e-mail her slides to the team members The remote will be sold for 25 Euro. The profit aim is fifteen million Euro. The remote will be sold on an international scale. The maximum production cost for the remote is 12.50 Euro. One remote will contain main functions such as on, off, channel changing, and volume. An additional remote will contain special functions.

{"meeting_id":"ES2008b","dialogue":"A: Good to see you all again . A: Let's see if that comes up . A: This is our functional design meeting . A: Um . A: Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up . A: Et voila . A: Okay . A: Mm um we put the fashion in electronics . A: Let's start . A: Okay , our agenda today um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . A: Um . A: I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um did you all get the minutes ? A: I e-mailed them to you . A: I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . C: Yep . A: So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . B: Right . A: Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . A: Finally we'll just close . A: We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . A: So First of all the functional design objectives . A: Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . A: Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um . D: Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ? A: Sure , please do . D: I dunno . D: How do I hook my screen up ? B: I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . A: Yes I do . A: Yeah . C: Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there Ah that's it , yep . D: Where does it go ? D: Mm-hmm . D: Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this , but Where's function ? C: And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop . A: Function , F_ eight , yeah . A: The blue one , F_N_ . D: No signal . A: Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and Mm 'kay . D: Ah , wait , 's screw in . B: Yeah . B: I I think you just have to push it in really hard . D: Push the screw . C: That's it . B: Oh , got it . D: Mm alright I've never attached to anything . A: It's taking it a little bit 'Kay there you go . B: Mm , neither have I . D: Alright , so , I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . B: Alright . D: But , I don't even know how to play this . D: No . A: Press the little presentation . A: It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw . A: There , that one , there you go . D: Alright . D: So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . D: Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . D: They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . D: What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . D: Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . D: I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . B: Hmm . D: Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . D: Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . B: Kay . D: That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . D: I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . D: People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . B: Hmm . D: It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know . C: Repetitive strain injury . D: What ? C: Repetitive strain injury . D: Ah . D: There we go . D: Wow . C: So if you Cheers . D: People do not like that . D: So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . D: Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . D: People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . D: And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . D: People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . D: So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . D: So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . D: But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . D: And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . B: Hmm . A: Thank you very much . A: That was that was great . B: Mm 'kay . A: Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . A: Was that you ? D: Hmm . A: Great . D: Yeah , have I unscrewed it ? A: Push . A: User interface , right . A: Interface . D: Here we go . D: Mm-hmm . D: And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . A: Mm 'kay , thank you . B: Okay , great . A: Okay . C: Here we go . C: Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . C: We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . C: It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . C: We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . C: Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? C: First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . C: We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . C: Um . C: Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . C: Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . C: Um , and different different people sort of prefer different things . A: Hmm . C: Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . C: When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . C: So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . C: But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . C: Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . C: Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . C: The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . C: So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . A: Hmm . C: So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . C: In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . C: Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . C: Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . C: Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . C: The one on the right is a lot more basic . C: It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . C: It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . C: There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . C: Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . C: So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . C: Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . C: Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . C: It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . C: I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . A: Mm 'kay . A: Thank you very much . A: That was very useful . A: It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . B: Hmm . A: Um . A: And neither of them were very pretty , you know ? D: No . B: Yeah . B: I think that could be our selling point . A: Mm . D: A fashion fashion remote . C: I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . B: Right . A: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . C: And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . B: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already . A: You there it is . A: Lovely . D: So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ? C: Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . D: Okay . D: Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google . A: Hmm . B: Yeah . B: Alright um No , how do I play again ? A: Um the it's right above Draw . A: There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . B: Ah . A: Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . A: Yeah , that one . A: There are Y_s . B: Okay . B: So this is our working design presentation . B: Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . B: Um so , yeah , this is this . B: Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . B: Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . B: It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . B: Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah . B: So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . B: So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . B: So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . B: And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . B: So um Uh . A: You just press yeah , just click . B: Uh . A: That'll be fine . B: So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . B: So that's one thing we're gonna work on . B: Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . B: And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . B: So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . B: So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . B: You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . B: You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh . A: Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous . B: Previous . B: Sorry about that , guys . A: Pardon . B: Oh . A: Oh , well . B: No , no , no , no , no . A: Okay . B: Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here . A: Ye Double click on it . A: With the right with the left hand one . B: W yeah , yeah . B: I think it's frozen . B: Here . B: Don't show me that tip again . A: There we are . B: There we are . B: Sorry about this , guys . B: I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . B: Um alright . B: So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . B: So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . B: This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . A: Mm-hmm . B: And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . B: We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . B: We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . A: Mm-hmm . B: So that's pretty much it for the working design . A: Excellent . A: So , um . B: Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? A: Yes , absolutely . A: Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things . B: Yeah . A: Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ? B: Yeah . C: What's up ? C: Lefty loosey . A: Lefty loosey , righty tighty . C: Uh . C: Never heard that before , that's good . A: Oh yes . C: I'll think of that every time now . B: It's gonna stick in your head . D: Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you . A: Mm 'kay . A: Um I have nothing on my screen . A: Just a sec . B: Mm . A: Here we are . B: Ooh , no signal . A: Okay , yeah , it's fine . A: Okay , requirements . A: We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . B: Okay . A: We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that . D: What's teletext ? A: Um . B: Uh , it's a British thing . D: Oh . C: You don't have it in the States ? D: Oh , so Mm-hmm . B: No . A: It no . A: W d could would you care to explain it ? C: Oh , I didn't realise . C: Um yeah , it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . C: Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . C: And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . B: S Lottery numbers and sport scores . C: Yep , news headlines . B: But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . A: How ? D: Oh . C: It's earl it's pretty old technology . C: It's like nineteen eighties . A: Okay . D: That explains a lot . B: I have no idea why we don't have it , but 'Kay . D: That's good . A: Interesting . A: Okay um , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . A: Um Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . A: Just for television . A: That's what we're focused on . C: Right . A: Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . A: We only have a a short amount of time . A: Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . A: So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . B: Mm . C: So what's our corporate image like ? C: It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . A: Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm . C: It's like double R_ . C: Yeah . A: But it's , yeah , we put the um fashion in electronics . A: So we gotta keep that in that in mind . B: Okay , so we want something that looks good and is yellow . A: Yep . A: Yep . A: Yeah , or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . B: Okay . A: Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . A: Um . A: Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . A: We need to decide who our target group is . A: You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um and so who are we aiming this at ? B: Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this . D: Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? A: Mm-hmm . A: It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is . B: Mm-hmm . C: Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? C: Cause that would affect the way that we market it . A: Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . C: Right . C: Right , okay . D: The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . B: Mm-hmm . D: I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . B: Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . C: Yeah . A: Now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition . A: Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? C: Um . B: Mm . C: I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . C: Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: To produce it , yeah . A: To produce it , yes . C: And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . A: Mm . D: But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . D: So like other than just making it look good , how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? C: Yeah . B: Hmm . B: But right . B: Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? B: Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , in fact it could use it could mean , not . D: Mm-hmm . A: That's a good thing to keep in mind . B: If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . D: If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? D: I dunno . A: Upgrade ? A: Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly . B: Yeah , simplification . C: Yeah . A: Simplification , so Uh-huh , mm . D: Mm-hmm . B: They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . D: Mm-hmm . A: And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or Kind of pull out of the side . B: Hmm . D: Can you like I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . C: Yeah . B: Ooh . C: The remote There are remote controls like that , yeah . D: Do you know what I'm saying ? C: Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . A: Mm . B: Ooh . C: So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones , but 's all still in one . B: Yeah , that's a good idea . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: I think that's a good idea , yeah . B: Mm . A: Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . D: Yeah . B: Good point . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Um . A: Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? A: I what in this project ? C: Si simplicity and fashion . D: I think simplicity , fashion . A: Simplicity and fashion . B: Yeah mm . A: Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . A: Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? A: Um . D: I'm just wondering . A: I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my Mm-hmm . D: Okay . B: The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . D: So 's just the quality of the chip . B: Yeah . B: I think so . D: Okay . B: The quality uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line . C: Yeah . A: So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? D: Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing Yeah . A: S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . D: Yeah . D: I don't . C: It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . B: Mm-mm . A: Seems a little bit Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , and it might be too expensive . D: And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . B: Ooh . B: Yeah . D: Mm yeah . D: Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . B: I Mm-hmm . D: But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so Twenty to like fifty five . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . A: Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . C: Yep . A: Um . A: I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? A: Cause that would go up to like fifty ? B: Or like single professionals or something . A: Okay , single It's it's hard to narrow it down . B: Yeah . D: I dunno . B: It's really hard to figure out right now . C: I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . A: Mm-hmm . C: I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . A: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , like , well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . A: Right . C: Yeah . C: Yeah aim for a an income group . B: That's a good point . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Mm . A: So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but Okay . B: Yeah , t probably . C: Yeah . A: Um oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? B: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know like or beep ? D: H I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . B: Mm . D: It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , so Hmm . A: Mm . B: Yeah , that'll probably be good . A: Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . A: So let's do that quickly . A: Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . C: Yep . B: Yeah . A: And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Large , accessible buttons for the essentials . A: We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . A: Mm-hmm . A: Um , yeah , hidden way . A: And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah Mm-hmm . D: on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . B: Yeah . B: Alright . A: Okay , do it . A: Any other essential functions that we need ? A: Battery ? A: Do we need a long-life battery ? B: Battery battery use . B: Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . D: Yeah . A: But we might as well . D: So you never have to change the battery . B: Yeah . C: We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . C: I suspect the remote control does need a battery , but I dunno if you can Yeah . A: Yeah , I would imagine . B: Yeah . A: Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the Charging . B: Mm . B: It I think it does . B: I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . C: Yeah , without the energy , yeah . B: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . C: Yeah , that's that's possible . B: You could we could maybe do that instead . C: Yeah . B: So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . C: Yeah . B: I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . A: We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? B: Mm . A: I don't know , just think okay , that's that's a good idea , we'll keep it . B: Yeah . A: Think it's And maybe fun . B: That's just off the top of my head . A: Okay . A: Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and 'kay . C: Yep . A: Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . A: I don't know what summarisation . A: Um and then we'll have our lunch break . A: After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . A: Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . A: If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . A: Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . A: And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . A: And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . B: Yeah , who knows . A: It's kinda frustrating , but um Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary . B: Okay Sounds good . A: Mm 'kay ? A: Great seeing y'all . D: It's good . D: Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? B: Yes , I just did that . D: Okay . B: Hopefully it is there for people . D: Yep . B: Yeah ? A: Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , I think so um Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . B: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Where is that ? D: Yours is I only have three , I just have like our three . B: Technical . B: So in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . A: Projects . B: At least that's what I have in . B: Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose So . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: You don't have mine ? D: No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server . A: S Mm . B: Yeah . D: But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . D: Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the Okay . A: Okay . A: Well I'll figure that out in the meantime . B: Okay . A: Okay .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes, finding that users wanted fancier looking remotes, disliked losing their remotes, wanted remotes with fewer buttons, frequently use the channel changing and volume buttons, and that younger users wanted speech recognition. The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one. He presented two remotes currently on the market and the advantages and disadvantages to each design. The industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group, the option to include speech recognition, how to find a remote when lost, and batteries. Each team member will complete a questionnaire and a summary. The team members will spend time on their individual work. The project manager will post the minutes and project documentation. The team members will post their project documentation. The industrial designer will work on the components concept. The user interface designer will work on the user interface concept. The marketing expert will work on trend watching The team will not work with teletext. The remote will be used only with televisions. The corporate image must be recognizable on the remote. The team's design will focus on simplicity and fashion. Rather than define a specific target group by age, the team will define objectives such as fashion and simplicity instead. The remote will contain a function to aid in its recovery when lost. The remote will have large buttons for essential functions. The remote will have a possibility to get extra functions. The buttons for extra, infrequently used functions will be hidden in the design in some manner. The remote will have a charging station. Deciding on a target group. Whether to include speech recognition in the design of the remote. How to make infra-red more functional. What sort of battery to use.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, the team gathered to discuss the objectives and presentations for their new project. The participants, including A leading the meeting, B, C, and D, delved into the user requirements and market research findings related to remote control functions. They explored the desire for fashionable and user-friendly remotes, noting preferences for simplicity and aesthetics. The team debated the inclusion of voice recognition, considering its cost implications and target demographic of individuals aged 15 to 35. They emphasized the need for large, accessible buttons, a long-lasting battery, and a potential feature to locate a lost remote. Decision-wise, they opted not to include teletext and focused solely on television remotes, aiming for a yellow and black design to align with their corporate image.

The participants, including A leading the meeting, B, C, and D, delved into the user requirements and market research findings related to remote control functions. They explored the desire for fashionable and user-friendly remotes, noting preferences for simplicity and aesthetics. The team debated the inclusion of voice recognition, considering its cost implications and target demographic of individuals aged 15 to 35. They emphasized the need for large, accessible buttons, a long-lasting battery, and a potential feature to locate a lost remote. Decision-wise, they opted not to include teletext and focused solely on television remotes, aiming for a yellow and black design to align with their corporate image.

{"meeting_id":"ES2008c","dialogue":"A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm yeah . A: Okay . A: I g yeah . A: Time is it ? D: Fourteen twenty six . A: Okay . A: Lovely to see you all again . A: Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . A: Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . B: Okay . A: So opening . A: Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . A: We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . A: Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . A: And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . A: Okay , now three presentations . A: I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . B: That would be me . C: Yep . B: Alright . B: Well . A: Mm . A: kay . A: Function F_ eight it . A: There we go . B: Alright . B: Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . B: Components design . B: This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . B: Um . B: So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . B: The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . B: These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . B: The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . B: I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . B: That would be our case . B: Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . A: Mm . B: Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . B: And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . B: We're talking about long-life batteries here . B: Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . B: Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . B: Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . A: Hmm . B: Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . B: Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . B: So those are our options . B: Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . B: So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . B: Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . B: We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . B: And we wanna go for simplicity . B: Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ? A: Mm . B: I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . B: And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . B: Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . B: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . B: But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . B: Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . B: So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . B: That's what I have for options . B: Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . D: Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? B: I'm not sure . B: I haven't received any specific visuals of this yet . D: Okay . D: Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , but I've no idea . B: This is what I'm sort of Yeah . B: I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . D: Sounds good . A: Yeah , I wonder Mm-hmm . B: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . B: But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . B: Space-age remote . B: Just all things to keep in mind . A: Just an interesting marketing kind of element . B: Yeah . B: That's about all I have to do , guys . B: I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . A: Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , okay . B: Yeah , n no idea , no idea . B: Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , um but other than that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Alright ? B: Any other questions ? C: Uh-huh . C: Don't think so . B: No ? B: Okay . A: Mm 'kay . B: I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . A: Thank you , perfect . D: Thanks . B: Uh Just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . A: Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that . B: Alright ? B: Uh I guess I can I know . A: Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . A: Yeah , um . A: This one's so much tighter than the other one . A: Okay . A: Nope . A: There we go . A: Here you are . C: Jess . B: G oh , geez . C: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . C: Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . C: We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . C: Um other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . C: Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . C: We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . C: Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . C: And of course we also have to make it look cool . C: So basically , that's what we don't want . C: M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . C: We want something that looks nice and simple . C: Here's a a fairly simple device . B: Hmm . C: This is an an iPod from Apple . C: Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . C: It's very minimalistic in its design . C: Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . C: Um the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . C: Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . C: They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . C: Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . C: So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . C: Um here's a another example . C: This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . C: Um it's certainly got novelty value . C: Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . A: Mm . C: Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . C: The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . C: So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . C: So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . C: I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . C: So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . C: Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . C: Um but these are these are all necessary functions . C: Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . C: Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . C: So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . B: Hmm . C: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . A: Okay . B: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? C: I think that's that's one way to go , yes . B: Okay . C: Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . B: Mm-hmm . C: There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . B: Right . C: Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . A: Mm-hmm . B: Right . C: The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . C: Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . A: Mm-hmm . C: I mean that that's also a good idea . B: Okay . C: It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . A: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . C: Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . B: Kay . A: I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . A: Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . C: Yeah . B: Well Are you are you tak Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Like I I know I use that often enough . D: Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? A: Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a Okay . B: No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . C: Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . A: Okay . C: But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . A: Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , mm-hmm . B: Oh , good point . A: Mm . C: Um I'm not sure . B: Yeah . A: Okay , now we're moving on to market . D: Should I plug that in ? A: Marketing . C: Is that going on ? C: Okay . D: Maybe it's just not Is it on ? C: Uh that should be alright , actually . D: Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ? A: Eight . D: I just keep pressing lots of 'em . D: Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . D: If anything , the that they gave me . B: No signal . A: Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . D: Alright . A: There we are . B: Oop , there we go . A: Mm 'kay . D: Oh yeah . D: Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . D: Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . D: So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . D: And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . B: Okay . D: The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . D: That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . D: And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . D: I don't know how much we agree with that . D: And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . A: S sweet . D: And so that brings us to my personal preferences . D: Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . D: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . D: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . D: Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . D: But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . B: Mm . B: That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . D: Yeah . D: I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . D: So yeah . A: Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um . D: Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? A: Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? A: Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? A: Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? A: It would be easier on the hands . B: If it's latex if it's latexy Um , mean An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . A: It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . C: A kind of thing that Yeah . A: But Mm-hmm . B: It's there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and Yeah , something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . B: could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? B: We could colour-co-ordinate them , li The buttons could be fruit-shaped . A: F for sure , or maybe like um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . A: Could they be smelly ? C: I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? B: Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it ? D: Oh God . C: Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . A: I don't know . A: Or carrot shaped , mm . C: Maybe , or Kind of like a potato . B: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . A: Like large button , that's what I was thinking of , yeah . D: What about the idea of like a round remote ? D: Instead of like a vertical up and down one . D: Like in terms of holding it . D: Like that's a f shape of a fruit . B: be yeah . B: It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . D: Just to tie it in a little . A: Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? C: Yeah . A: Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah . B: It'd be harder to press button . C: Depends . A: Harder to push . C: When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? D: Yeah . C: Or your fingers ? B: Um I Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it . A: I usually hold it in one hand . A: Maybe But then the buttons would have to be very small . C: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . D: Yeah , 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . A: Don't you think ? B: No just thumb-sized . B: Jus Yeah . D: But I like i I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . A: But I mean in order to get to all of them , you know . C: Yeah . A: They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . C: Maybe . B: That's true . C: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . B: Right . B: I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . A: Mm-hmm . C: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and And you find that works quite well ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . A: Mm-hmm . C: Is that The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? D: Cause th It's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle . A: It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . A: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . B: Ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . C: Right . C: Oh , I see , right , yeah . C: Oh , okay . B: Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . C: Yeah , that's quite a good design . D: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . B: Yeah . D: Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . B: Uh uh t Yeah . D: I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? B: Hmm . A: Mm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: And then you could still have that available . B: Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . C: I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . B: Yeah . C: Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that . D: Mm-hmm . B: Right . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? A: Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . D: Uh-huh . A: Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on . B: Kay . A: Um Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium . D: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . B: Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? C: Like , to make it different fruits . B: In different fruit and vegetable colours , yeah . C: Yeah , it's possible . B: Exactly . B: And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . C: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . B: All these options . C: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . B: Ooh . D: Well , there we go . B: Oh . C: Don't know . A: Ah hmm hmm hmm . D: The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . D: It's like the way it all comes all cute . B: Yeah . B: Mm . D: Lemons ? B: Options . A: Okay , um components concept . A: Energy , chip on print . B: Uh-hu oh , oh yes . B: Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but um Alright , so um decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . A: G That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . A: So can you just explain what that is real quick ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? A: I think it's awesome . A: I think it's really cool . B: Am I Yeah . D: Yeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good . B: Right , I haven't gotten any yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . D: Costs . D: But over time Yeah , it's a But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . B: Um circuit boards . B: Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . B: They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . B: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . B: I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . A: Okay . B: Um yeah , I can't can't really tell you . B: I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . B: But I don't know any decisions on Yeah . A: If they're if they're really options . B: I'm sorry , I did f Yeah . A: Okay . C: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . C: Uh it's fairly fairly standard . A: Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . A: Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . B: Right . B: Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . B: Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . B: The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . B: Um , 'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . B: Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? C: Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . C: I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . B: Oh . A: It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . C: Uh but I don't think it would really work . A: Cause you don't have control over numbers or We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . C: Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . B: Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Hmm . A: So , have a scroll for volume ? B: F or for all those secret functions ? A: F Um . B: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . C: I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . B: Right . C: Um Yeah . B: So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . B: I don't know . A: I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . B: Okay . B: Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case . A: Okay , let's do case . B: Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . A: I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . B: Okay . A: Um Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . D: Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? B: Uh yeah , everything I've N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: The inside is hard . B: I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us . A: Ge o Okay . C: Kay . C: Yeah . A: So we uh we do want latex . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Latex . A: Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . B: Yeah . A: Fruity colours . A: Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . B: Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? B: Or a double-curved ? A: Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? D: I'm thinking curved of some sort . A: Yeah . B: Yeah , okay . C: Yeah . B: We don't really know what the difference Good point . A: Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . A: So push or scroll , right ? C: Um Yep . A: Or both ? C: Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . C: So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . A: Mm-hmm . A: And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . C: Yeah , yeah , it's uh it's it's fairly simple . A: I think that yeah . A: For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . B: Yeah . B: I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case because Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Is that okay with you ? C: Interesting . A: How you feeling ? D: Yeah . D: And let's like see if we get anything else . D: I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . A: Mm-hmm . A: It might be cool enough . A: Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ? C: Yep . C: Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? A: Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . C: Um Yep . B: Oh . A: So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? C: Yeah . A: Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . B: Alright . C: Um in Yeah . B: So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? B: On off So like one through five , or No . C: On off , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . C: Yeah , yeah about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . D: Like a radio type sorta situation ? C: Um Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . A: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ? C: I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . A: Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . C: Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example . B: Mm . B: Yeah , up down . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , um finishing the meeting now . A: Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . A: You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . B: Ooh . C: Cool . D: Wow . A: Um did we decide on a chip ? A: Let's go with a simple chip ? B: Simple chip . C: Yep . A: Okay . A: We are done . A: Thank you everyone . A: Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so . B: Okay , cool . B: Clay . C: Clay . C: I wasn't expecting that .","summary":"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.

{"meeting_id":"ES2008d","dialogue":"A: Okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . A: I'm pretty excited . A: Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . A: Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . A: We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . A: So , starting off with the um last the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . A: And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . A: Okay ? A: Let's do the look and feel design presentation first . C: Right , do you wanna start ? B: Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . B: Um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . B: Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . B: You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . B: Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . B: We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . B: If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . B: If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . B: If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . B: Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . B: That's our number one prototype . B: Um do you wanna present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ? A: like a little lightning in it . C: Okay , um What We call that one the rhombus , uh the rhombus . A: The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . D: I could Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? A: The v the rhombus rhombus ? B: That's the rhombus , yep . C: Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's it's a how can I present it ? C: It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . C: Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . C: Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . C: Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . C: So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . C: Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . C: Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it , that's the potato . A: Um on , off ? C: Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , yeah . A: Okay . A: Yeah we turn it off . C: Um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . A: Mm-hmm . B: If you pressed and held it maybe . C: Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . D: If you like held it down , that would be on off . B: Yeah . C: That'd work , yeah . B: On off , that's a possibility , yeah . A: Okay . B: And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . B: Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . B: Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . B: We have the five preset seeds . B: And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . B: So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . C: Let's pass . B: We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . A: Uh-huh . D: Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , I forgot . B: Uh the menu select button . A: Very interesting . A: I think that one's my favourite . C: So that's So that's our three prototypes . C: Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . A: Mm-hmm . B: We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it . A: Mm 'kay . B: Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but yeah . C: Would Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . A: Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . A: I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . C: Yeah . B: Right . B: Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . B: It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . A: Mm-hmm . B: So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss I think Yeah . D: But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . A: It's really Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? A: Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? C: I think it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: That's true , mm 'kay . C: Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? B: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , that's a fair evaluation . A: Getting lost . A: Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . A: Okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um Mm-hmm . B: So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? B: Um . D: I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . D: I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . D: But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . D: But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on . A: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? A: So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? B: Mm yeah , that's good , that's good . D: Ah , there we go . C: Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . B: Here , stick it on . C: Put an extra the button on . A: Sure . A: Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? D: Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . A: Oh okay . A: Okay . D: That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . B: So where Right . A: Okay . A: Do you need this or just write on the white board ? D: No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant . A: Okay . B: Okay . D: I dunno . A: It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it . B: Ooh . C: Cool . B: Hey . A: Kay . A: Maybe a little smaller than that . B: No , I kinda like it . B: That's hard to miss . C: It makes look more fruity as well . A: Oh it does , it's kind of like There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . C: It's like a deformed foot , I dunno . C: Yeah . B: Like Yeah . A: Yeah . A: It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers . C: Yeah . B: Interesting . A: I like this one . B: Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? A: Variety of colours are nice . B: I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . A: I think I'm leaning towards the potato . A: Mm-hmm . A: I am worried about like um using a menu . A: Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? B: Hmm . C: Yeah . B: Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . A: But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? C: Yeah . B: Good point . C: This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . A: Okay . C: You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh . A: Could these be used for going to submenus or Okay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . B: Maybe yeah , maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay . D: Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . B: The potato ? B: Are we leaning towards the potato ? C: Potato . A: I think so . B: Okay . D: So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . B: Okay . D: So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . B: Okay . D: So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . D: So we can do this one first . D: First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . D: So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . D: That's just my opinion . B: Yeah . D: What does each of you Okay , well give it a number , sorry . A: I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . A: Okay . A: I will give it a one . B: Um I dunno if it's it's creative . B: I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . B: I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two , because c unique . D: Okay . D: And two , awesome . C: I'll go for two . D: Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? D: I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . B: Yeah , one . D: One ? C: I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . D: Okay . A: Um functional . A: I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . D: Okay . D: Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah . A: Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . D: Awesome , okay . D: Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . A: Did you give a functional ? D: Yeah , she said it was one . A: Okay . D: Um is it technologically innovative ? D: Mm . D: Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . D: Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really I kinetic battery is a big one , so . A: Well , the kinetic battery . B: In the battery , that's it . B: How many people would notice that , though ? D: Mm . D: But it but we know it's there . A: But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . D: And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . A: Mm . D: I'll give it a three . A: Just the material . D: Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really Alright . B: Yeah . B: I I would say that it's Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . B: But does that equal innovative ? B: I dunno . B: I'll give it a three . D: Everyone else ? C: I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . A: Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . D: Mm 'kay . A: I really like that kinetic battery though . D: Next , is it easy to use ? D: Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . A: Mm 'kay . B: Okay . D: I think it's really easy to use . D: I'll give it a two . B: Um I'll give it a one . B: Pretty hard to mess up . C: I'll say one . A: Uh let's say two . D: Alright . D: Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way . A: Give it a one . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . B: Ooh , that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Cause there would be less impact maybe , . D: Iain , what do you give it ? B: Mm . C: Yeah I'd I'd give it a one . D: Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? C: Uh um . D: Well , is it gonna be yellow ? B: It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? A: That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . C: Yeah . B: We might wanna keep it yellow . D: Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , Yeah . A: Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? B: If we had a yellow Sure . A: Okay . D: Oh , yeah . D: Alright , so I think it it's Yeah . A: Fruity , so fruity . B: So it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . A: I think i it's kind of mangoey too . B: Oh , mango that that That's a much more trendy than a potato one . D: Yeah . C: Mangoey is better , yeah . D: I okay , I'm giving it a one the mango put me over . A: Yes . C: I like mangoes . A: Mm . D: What are what's everyone's numbers ? C: Uh two . A: One . D: Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? D: Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . D: I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , me too . C: Uh one . D: Did you say one , Rose ? A: Yes . D: Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . D: Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? D: I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . A: It's gonna be hard . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two . D: Um um worth the risk , I think . B: Yeah . B: I'll I'll say two as well . B: Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . A: Mm . D: Kay . C: Yeah I'll I'll say two . D: Alright , awesome . D: And the ease of learning it . D: I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . D: It sort of reminds me of the iPod . D: I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so and I'm not good at learning technology . A: Mm . D: So I'll give it a two . A: Mm-hmm . B: So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . C: I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , but once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . B: Oh , good point . D: Mm-hmm . C: So I'd I'd give it a four . D: Okay . A: I think I'd give it a four too . A: It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? D: I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . C: Yeah . B: Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . A: Mm I'd give it a four . C: Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . A: Small too . D: Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? B: Simple to use or simple in design ? B: Do you know ? D: I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . D: Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . B: Right . D: Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . B: I'm give it a three I guess . C: I'll give it a two . A: Three . D: Alright , and fashionable ? A: It's totally fashionable . D: It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on . A: I'd give it a one . A: Mango . D: I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? D: I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . B: I dunno . B: I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was . A: I do like uh the little Martian one . D: Yeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing . D: Number . B: Um two . C: Three . A: One . D: And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? D: Just that it would se serve our audience . D: I don't see why not . A: Mm-hmm . A: I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . A: Um yeah , that's good . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: So I'll give it a a two . B: Yeah , I'll say two . D: Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? A: Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . B: Shall we uh Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . A: All of them should have R_R_ , yeah . D: And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm 'kay . D: Okay . D: That's me . A: Lovely . A: Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . A: Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , so let me exit out of this first . A: Okay um I know . D: Whoa . B: Oh my . A: Let me one more space . A: Gonna zoom in real quick . A: Okay . A: Hand dynamo . A: We're using kinetic battery , right ? B: Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . A: Um and we're having one per One , okay . B: Yeah . A: Um electronics . B: Single . B: Simple , simple rather . A: Simple . D: Simple . A: Mm 'kay . A: Um the case . B: Uh uh uh double-curved . C: Guess it's double-curved . C: It is pretty curvy . D: Yeah . A: It's very curvy , so okay . B: Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know . B: Our case material supplements oops , we just skipped by them . D: Well don't we need plastic , and Provided , okay . B: No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . B: The supplement is Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex . A: The wood ? A: I mean the rubber . D: It was rubber and special colour , right ? B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm , okay . D: Do we have more than one special colour ? A: Yeah , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . B: Uh well I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . C: Special colours , isn't it ? A: Um . D: Per Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so Right . A: I dunno where it yeah . A: So let's y say three . B: Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . B: Is that two special colours ? A: Yeah , I dunno . B: Or or is white and black , then two more or Uh . A: That I thi I thought that would be under yours . B: I guess it's three , three three . A: We'll just say three . A: Mm-hmm . B: Alright . A: Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . A: Interface , we're doing push buttons . B: Yeah . A: And how many buttons do we have ? D: We have six . C: We've got five . D: Oh no , five . B: Six , with the power . C: Oh six . A: Six . B: Yeah . A: Anything else ? B: No . B: Oh , we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on Well , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused . D: Oh wait . A: Oh , buttons oh , so um . A: So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? D: Yeah . A: We're saying per unit . B: per unit , okay , okay . D: Yeah , per unit . A: Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . B: Alright , and each button s Yeah , okay . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: I like it like that . A: So Special form ? A: They're all kind of just push button , right ? B: No , I think they're fine . C: Yeah . A: Special material ? B: Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . A: Uh . A: Oh do I have to do it per button , do I ? B: No , I don't think so . B: I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . A: Okay . D: Yeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: It's I mean it's two to make it rubber . B: Okay . D: Oh wait , so maybe . A: Thirteen point seven . B: Oh oh . A: Yeah , what can we reduce ? B: Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . D: Mm , I kind of like the buttons . A: Let's see what that would do . A: It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . B: Alright . A: Okay um , are we sure this is double-curved ? B: Uh . A: Maybe it's single-curved , we have no idea . B: We have no idea . B: I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . D: It's single curved . B: It's single curved . B: Why not ? A: Well it's not the yeah . A: Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but that's important . B: Yeah . B: That is important . A: Six buttons we have to have six buttons . B: How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? A: What ? B: It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . A: No , okay , maybe not . A: I don't know what just happened . A: Now it's twelve . D: We Yeah , they are . C: What was our target price again ? B: Twelve point five . A: Twelve point five . B: Hey hey . C: Twelve point five . C: So we're just just about there . A: So we're okay , I think . B: We're all set then . A: Yeah . B: Ish . A: Okay , we're all set . B: Alright . A: Um save . A: I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . A: Um okay , back to agenda . A: Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? B: Yes . A: Yes . C: Yeah . A: Let's move on to the project evaluation . A: Project process . A: Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . A: So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . B: Well . A: Okay . B: I felt very creative . B: I enjoyed making the prototypes . C: I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost . B: Yeah . B: I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Um I think we worked together pretty well . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so . D: I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great . D: No , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . B: Do you think we could Yeah . D: That was a bit of a distraction . D: That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um I like our little finished products . B: Yeah . D: They're funny . A: Really cute . D: I kind of want one . B: Can we market this as the mango remote ? B: Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? B: I have a little R_R_ . D: I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there . A: I know , let's think of it like a little jingle . A: Um . D: I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . B: Yes . B: Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget . B: All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . A: Okay um new ideas found ? B: Mm . B: What did we find for new ideas ? B: People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . A: Definitely . C: Yeah . A: Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera . B: I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . A: Oh , I'm so excited . D: Yeah , I didn't even know they existed . B: That was I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist . A: Mm-hmm . B: But in other things , I think it'd be really good . A: I thi yeah , that's awesome . A: Um okay , closing . A: Are the costs within the budget ? A: Is the project evaluated ? B: Yes . A: Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . A: Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um yeah . B: Yeah . A: Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and . D: Yeah , Real Reaction . A: I do like the Martian remote . A: If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . D: Oh , that would definitely be my second choice . C: Mm . A: Although the tog toggle I'm afraid I would It's cool . C: That's cool . C: Let's all let's all go for the yellow Break the stem off . D: I would break it . D: I would break it . A: I think I would break it . B: It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright , so Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the Take me to your leader . D: Oh that's funny . D: Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . A: Oh yeah , it's kind of a penguin . D: I like that it stands up . A: Mm-mm . B: Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . B: So are are poor little thing . C: That was bound to happen Mm . D: Oh , sad . A: Mm 'kay , congratulations . A: Um . A: Anything else to say ? D: Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed . A: Alright . B: Oh . A: Um anybody have I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? D: Oh . B: It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . A: Yeah , but check it out . A: So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . A: But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . A: Um just wanna make sure you do . D: No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? A: Oh It is . D: It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot . A: Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . D: Oh here you can you can view . B: Let's see , what did I get through the corporate website ? B: It's just inspiration about circuit boards . D: You can just see what's up . A: Wow . D: Yeah it's it's really deep . D: Hold on . D: Takes a little while to get excited to load . D: That the Excel thing is pretty cool . A: Yes . B: Yeah , that is pretty neat . D: Here , like , basically it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . A: I love Excel , it's one of my favourite programs . D: You didn't miss out that much . A: I see , mm . B: Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . A: Spongy . B: I learned a lot actually . D: Oh wow . B: I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . D: This one was cooler . D: I got a whole table and everything . B: Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case . D: That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? D: And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result . B: It's really interesting though . A: I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . C: I think . C: Yeah . B: That was really neat how I got emails and No . C: We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . A: Mm-hmm . A: No . A: Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I Mm . B: I yeah . B: If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , but Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . D: Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . A: Mm-hmm . D: But I thought we were good orally . D: Get crazy . B: I think if you had a larger group Yeah . A: And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have . C: Yeah . D: And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . A: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Because we're all gonna be working in different places . D: Yeah . B: We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess . A: Mm-hmm . A: Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? C: Uh we we worked together , um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , um and how we could like improve on the on the design . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . A: Mm-hmm . A: Cool . B: It was fun . B: So well done with the management , I felt well managed . A: Oh thanks . C: I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . A: It's kinda fun . A: Mm . D: Sorry . C: And I I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . B: That happened to me all the time though . A: Mm-hmm . C: But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . B: Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so . A: Mm-hmm . B: I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . A: This is what we'll do . C: Yeah . A: I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . C: Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah . B: Especially last time , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , you know what I mean , like we we couldn't answer every single question . B: Yeah , Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Right . A: Um but Mm . B: And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . B: I had so much information and so much to talk about . A: It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even . B: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Um . A: I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . B: Yeah . B: that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like Yeah . A: About yeah . D: Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like yeah , it has it included . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: I think we were Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there . A: Considered the re yeah . B: I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . A: Well it's interesting that they Mm-hmm , yeah . B: I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , but Yeah . A: It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that . D: Yeah . A: I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is , but Mm . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . B: I dunno . B: I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs . A: Hmm . D: That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . D: You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: Yeah . A: It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . B: But , I mean I am notorious for losing my keys , I just I guess I've just never lost the remote . B: I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . B: Cause I was putting groceries away . D: That's funny . A: Oh . B: You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . A: Can't get in . B: Can't get in , look all around the kitchen . B: Definitely in the vegetable drawer . D: That's funny . B: So . D: I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . B: Mm . A: Yep . B: But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . D: Yeah . D: Can't really take it into the other room . B: Yeah . B: Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located Oh a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ . D: Oh man . D: Here you go . B: Although if it's sitting still for too long . A: We should make one that walks by itself . B: Yes I Or little Or just just a wheel , you know . D: That really could get up and walk away . A: Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . B: Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll . C: Yeah . A: Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can . B: zoom Yeah . B: Hmm . B: All kinds of possibilities . A: Mm . A: Okay . A: Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . A: I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . B: Yeah . A: Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . B: Oh . B: Wow . A: Cause that seems a little more useful . B: Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . A: But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so Most of it , mm-hmm . B: Yeah , I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting . A: I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time , but that was about it . B: Oh . B: Okay . B: Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more . A: Mm . A: Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . B: Ah yeah. . A: And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . A: I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three . B: Right . D: You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like Okay good . A: The slogan on it ? B: No , no , definitely not . A: No no no . B: We No , I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . D: Cause I was like , it could go around the outside . A: I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah . D: Is it yellow and blue ? B: Or yellow and blue . B: Lemme go to the web page . A: Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . D: Oh I guess it is black , grey . D: Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish . A: I don't really like yellow in general . D: Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings . A: But it Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um the marketing choices , you know , like that was a bit of a conflict . B: Finish meeting now . D: Yes . D: I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . B: Yeah . D: S mm , I dunno . A: People are stupid . B: I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? B: Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue . D: Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good . B: Yeah . B: Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway . A: Maybe , like I don't know . A: That could always be . B: Well we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so . A: Oh . D: If they ever come out with potato I'm gonna have to Yeah . B: Potato mango shaped remotes . A: I'm claiming it intellectual property . B: I can't believe a whole day is gone . D: I know . B: I don't feel like it's been that long . B: Get sucked in . B: Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .","summary":"The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. *NA* The remote will resemble the potato prototype. There will be no feature to help find the remote when it is misplaced; instead the remote will be in a bright color to address this issue. The corporate logo will be on the remote. One of the color concepts for the remote will contain the corporate colors. The remote will have six buttons. The buttons will all be one color. The case will be single curve. The case will be made of rubber. The case will have a special color. Whether or not to have a feature which helps find the remote when it is misplaced.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the detailed design meeting, A led the team through a packed agenda, including reviewing the minutes, prototype presentations, evaluation criteria, finances, and production evaluation. B showcased three unique prototypes: the rhombus, the potato, and the Martian, each with distinct features like buttons layout and ergonomic design. The team discussed the use of kinetic batteries, rubber cases, and colorful buttons, aiming to keep costs under \u20ac12.50 per unit. They made decisions on form, button layout, and color schemes, leaning towards fruity colors but considering a more subdued option for a broader market appeal. Despite a brief diversion into discussing lost remotes and potential solutions, the team focused on evaluating the project process, creativity, teamwork, and leadership, with C highlighting the importance of clear decision-making at the end of meetings. The meeting concluded with A ensuring the costs were within budget and assigning a final questionnaire to gather feedback. Despite some humorous tangents and technical glitches, the team successfully navigated the meeting, showcasing creativity and collaboration in designing the innovative remote control prototypes.","relevance":0.5641921163,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the three unique prototypes showcased during the meeting?","answer":"The rhombus, the potato, and the Martian."},{"question":"What were some features discussed for the remote control prototypes?","answer":"Features like button layout, ergonomic design, kinetic batteries, rubber cases, and colorful buttons."},{"question":"What was the team's approach to keeping costs under \u20ac12.50 per unit?","answer":"Decisions on form, button layout, and color schemes, leaning towards fruity colors but considering a more subdued option for broader market appeal."},{"question":"How did the team evaluate the project process and teamwork during the meeting?","answer":"The team focused on evaluating creativity, teamwork, and leadership, with an emphasis on clear decision-making at the end of meetings."}]}

B: Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . A: Like that ? A: Okay , cool . D: We're good ? B: Oh , I think mine's fallen off . C: It fell That's why . D: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . D: Mm . D: Uh okay . C: Ah . A: Okay ? A: Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . B: Wow . A: Yeah , PowerPoint . D: Very official . A: Yeah , well , you know , . A: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . A: Right . A: Um . A: So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right . A: Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . A: Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . A: Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . A: Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . A: Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . A: Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um y is Exactly . D: You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . D: Fair enough . A: Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . A: I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um . D: Prove it yeah , okay . A: And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . A: So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? B: Oh yeah , that's fine . C: Sure . D: Works for me . A: Sweet . A: Cool . A: So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website . B: Right . A: Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . A: So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . A: Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . A: And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember , the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright , getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . C: Mm . D: There you go . A: And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . A: Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . A: So that's the detailed design . A: So it's a three stage kind of thing . A: Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . A: Oh , we skipped introductions . A: Nice . A: I'm a excellent Project Manager . A: Um . A: I'm Marty , um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . A: Um yeah . A: So Expert Don't play yourself down . D: I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . D: Marketing , yeah Expert . D: Expert . D: Fine . A: Expert Where did you go to uni Nathan ? D: That's me . C: I'm Ron . C: I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer . B: I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . B: U_C_L_A_ . A: Oh brilliant . B: Yeah . A: Cool . A: My little brother goes there . B: Okay . A: Right so desert island discs . D: So . A: Yeah . D: So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? A: Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . D: I'm waiting to know . A: See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it , it's rubbish but I love it . D: Uh Fair enough . D: Oh , Smallville . D: I went to high school with Tom Willing actually . A: T the the main c the main character ? D: The guy . A: Wow . D: Yeah . A: Is he a wanker ? D: Yeah . D: Very much so . D: Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless . A: He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six . D: Yeah . D: He is a big guy . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley . A: You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . A: Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead . A: It's a r Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . D: Good call . A: It's kinda weird . A: Anyway yeah . D: Interesting . A: Yeah , you're like press and it's . A: Kinda cool . A: You'll see . A: Alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . D: I guess I'll go next then . C: Go for it . A: Right on . D: Okay . D: Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . D: Okay . D: This is basically just pen practice huh ? A: W Mm . D: Okay . D: Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here . D: Um . D: Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , local Michigan folk singer , really lame and uh uh what else did I bring with me ? A: Nice . B: Wow . D: Probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah I think . A: Okay yeah yeah . D: And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down . A: Well yeah . A: Oh , family guy . D: So yeah . A: Isn't h has h do you watch the new season ? D: No . D: Are you getting it online , or is it on sky ? A: I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah . D: Yeah , that'd be nice . C: Alright . C: Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_ . C: Anybody ? A: Mm-mm . B: No . C: No ? D: Fraid not . C: no ? C: Afro beat orchestra , very cool . A: Afro beat orchestra ? C: Yeah . A: Very cool . D: Mm . C: Fift S they like fifteen members from Brooklyn . B: Sounds nice . A: Mm . C: Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium , in Brussels in April first . A: Wow . D: Exciting . C: Yeah . C: It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways . D: That'd be . C: Um thing I love about Edinburgh Love um I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . D: Oh . D: I didn't even read those . D: Oops . D: I shouldn't admit that . A: That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . B: Oh , wow . A: It's they're designed specifically to ignore . A: I it's th brilliant . D: Yeah . D: It's the five by five , I can't read that much . A: Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . A: Vomit . A: Yes . D: Yeah oh it's so horrible . A: Street pizza . A: It's so brilliant . A: I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , I mean It's so minging . D: Oh my God . D: Seriously ? B: There's more vomit there . C: Um . C: I w Does uh yeah . D: It really is Yeah . A: Uh . C: Ready ? B: Alright . B: Yep . C: Minging ? C: Nice . A: I'm going local . D: Slide it in there . A: Going local . D: Yeah . A: I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right . D: Yeah fair enough . D: I've already got more than I can keep track of . D: And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , no . A: Oh , have you been home yet ? A: They'll be like , say something British , and you're like oh shut up family . D: I know . D: I know . C: Uh-huh . B: Um Let's see . D: Oh it should be interesting . D: Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back . D: They're gonna love that one . A: Right you s you're gonna stay here ? D: Probably . D: Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide . A: Wow . D: Cause nice . A: Bad religion ? C: Nice . B: Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to . D: Of course . A: Yeah yeah , yeah . D: Oh , now I can think of so many other ones . B: And so there Something I miss about my hometown . A: Well yeah that's why yeah . D: That's how it works . A: I miss coffee . B: Burritos that cost less than eight Pounds . D: Mm . C: Nice . A: Burritos . D: Oh Any thing that are like free . A: Oh yeah two two bucks . A: Where are you from in California by the way ? B: I grew up in San Diego , but yeah um La Jolla , P_B_ . A: Did you really ? A: What part ? A: Yeah I'm from San Diego as well . D: Nice . A: Yeah oh man . B: But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . A: Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . B: It's different . B: Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . D: It must make all the difference . B: Yeah , it really does . A: Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that . D: Ah . B: Mm . D: Right . B: Yeah . B: Where you from in San Diego ? D: Mm . A: Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . B: Okay . A: So North Park actually if you want to get real specific . B: Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second . A: Yep . B: Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and Cafe Forte Cool . A: Yes . A: On university , yeah . A: Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . A: Yeah , pretty cool . A: Small world as we were discussing before . B: Yeah . A: Especially when we're all from the same general region . A: Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . D: There you go . A: You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance . B: Wow . A: Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . A: Um . A: This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . A: It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . D: Mm . A: Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . A: Eur internationally . A: So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . B: Okay . A: Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . D: Makes sense . D: Uh . A: Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . A: So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . A: Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . A: Um . A: Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . A: Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . A: Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . D: What they're looking for . A: So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . D: And negotiate that . D: Uh . A: But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . A: Um any questions , before we get started ? C: I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products . A: You mean to like Hmm . C: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . B: Mm . B: Sounds interesting . A: Yeah . D: I don't think there's any rules about it yet . D: So Yeah . B: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . C: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? A: Well , have a think about it . D: Mm . A: I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . C: Yep . C: Okay . D: W yeah . A: I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: The clapper . A: No I mean no , good idea , good idea . A: We'll see what see what Uh-huh y I like that Yeah . B: Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . D: I like the little cover thingies . C: Nice . B: Yeah . C: Hot . A: That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um I don't really have any . A: Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . A: Uh project announcement . A: Ts ts ts Yeah . A: Not so much . D: Hmm . A: All right we'll find them , we're on our own . C: Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? A: Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . C: S does anybody have any initial ideas ? A: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right . D: Good idea . D: Start your minutes . D: Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can't tell what they do . A: So initial ideas . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: S smaller's better . A: Mm-hmm . B: Simple . D: Yeah . C: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . D: Specific . D: Okay . B: Oh right . B: That'd be different . D: Interesting . A: Yeah that's slick isn't it . A: I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah . D: True . A: Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . A: Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality . D: Mm . D: Mm . A: Um and we also I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? D: Right . D: We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole yeah . B: Yeah . C: Too confusing . B: It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . D: Hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . C: Possibly . A: I don't think one exists . D: An interesting option . A: Be a good idea . B: Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . D: Yeah . D: Definitely . A: Yeah all the other universal remotes . A: Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one Okay . D: Right . C: I'm pretty sure there is . C: I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . A: Okay . D: That Yeah . A: Interesting . D: Awesome . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Um all right . A: So . A: I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um . B: Right . A: Um . A: Let's see . B: I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . D: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . D: And I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . B: Mm . C: Oh . A: Uh let's see . A: Um . C: I like the idea of the uh multi plate . A: Yeah yeah okay . D: Yeah . D: Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? C: In in I like . D: Isn't there a name for them ? A: Think they're just called face plates ? D: Are they ? A: I don't know . B: something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it . D: I dunno . C: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . D: Yeah . D: Something really cool . C: For those cold winter days . D: Leopard print or something . B: Leopard print . A: Um . D: Hmm . B: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . D: True . A: Mm . A: But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . D: Right . B: Mm . A: Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . C: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . B: True . C: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying . D: True . D: Right . A: Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , could we do something like that ? C: Th Yeah . D: Right . B: Yeah . D: Right . C: That's cool . B: I think so . D: Probably . C: I think we could design into that . B: Yeah . D: Good . A: Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah . D: Mm . D: Yeah . D: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . B: Mm . C: Curves . D: Mm . A: Yeah . A: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . D: Right . A: Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . D: Right . B: Yeah . D: Mm . D: Definitely . A: But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um Mm . D: Yeah . D: Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . B: Yeah . B: S true . D: But Euros . C: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? A: Twenty five Euros . C: Slight difference I guess . A: Yeah . A: They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar . D: Mm . A: Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . A: Like um do you guys know Fry's ? A: Huge computer uh electronics store ? C: No . D: Mm-mm . A: They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . D: Mm . A: Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . D: Okay . B: Okay . A: And uh right so thanks for that . A: Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . D: With half an hour ? A: Um . A: Yes . D: Kay . D: Perfect . A: Thanks guys . D: Cool . C: Thank you . B: Alright .","summary":"The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new, fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant.

{"meeting_id":"ES2009b","dialogue":"A: All set ? A: Okay . A: Cool . A: Right . A: So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . A: And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . A: So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . A: So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . D: Okay . A: Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . A: Um so that's red and black . A: And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . A: Um and no teletext . A: I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . A: For reasons that I don't really know . A: There's but it's the board so there you go . A: So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . A: Anyway . A: So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on Oh , right yeah . B: Okay . B: So do I unplug this bit here ? D: Gotta plug you in . A: Yep . A: Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . A: Yep . A: Cool . B: Okay . B: Right . B: That's page one of my presentation . A: Brilliant . D: Very nice . D: For your first PowerPoint it's lovely . B: So the uh method . B: We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . B: Um remote control works as follows . B: This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . B: Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . B: A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . B: So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . B: And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . B: Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . B: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . A: Kay . B: Um , components . B: Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . B: Um the user interface , I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . A: Mm . B: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . B: Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . A: Kay . B: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . A: Fair enough . A: Kay . B: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . B: Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . B: Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking Right . D: Fine . A: Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? D: It needs , yeah . B: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . B: Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . A: Okay , okay . D: Cool . B: That's the end of my presentation . A: Great . A: Thank you very much Nathan . A: Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well . A: S plug yourself in here . A: Mm . A: Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down Mm . D: Looks like you're in okay . B: Is it plugged in well ? B: There it goes . B: Computer adjusting . C: Th Well so . D: There you go . A: There you go . A: Sweet . C: Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . C: Um so a few of the requirements we need here . C: Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . A: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before . C: Um so some of my findings . C: Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . C: Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . C: Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . A: Oh yeah look at that . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . C: As you also notice it's quite a boring design . C: Um . C: Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . C: Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . C: So my personal preferences . C: Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . A: Nice . C: Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . C: And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . C: Um . A: Okay . C: Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh . A: Great . A: Thanks for that Ron . D: Right . D: Does that mean I'm up ? A: Kay yep that's you . D: I think so . D: Okay . C: I can plug you in . D: Oh that would be perfect . D: Thank you . D: Slide show up and running . D: Or not . A: Give it a little bit . D: Uh . D: Oh there we go . D: Perfect . D: Okay . D: So this is me . D: Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . D: Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . D: Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . D: And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . D: And then they can't find it in the room . D: So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . D: Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . D: I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . D: Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . D: So it's a good start for us . A: That's great . A: Thank you Sarah . A: Right . D: Need to unplug this ? A: So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here . D: Need it back . A: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . D: There you go . A: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . A: Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um . D: Oh right . D: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . A: Yes . A: So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . A: Um . D: Right . A: So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly . D: Right . D: Uh . A: Um so um . A: How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . D: Right . B: Mm . A: Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up . D: Yeah . B: Right . B: I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . A: Mm . D: Oh . D: That could work . D: I like that . B: With a simple command like locate . D: Yeah . B: And then it could start to beep and therefore be found . D: Something very basic . D: Right . A: Right . C: Sounds good . D: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? B: Oh yeah I think that's very doable . D: Okay . A: The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . A: Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . B: Mm . D: Yeah . B: It's a good point . C: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . D: Mm . C: And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: K Yeah . A: Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . C: So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . D: True . C: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . D: Making it just an option ? B: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Right . B: I was thinking uh Oh go ahead . A: Yeah . D: Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . D: Go ahead . D: The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? A: Mm-hmm . C: S definitely an option technically . D: Okay . C: I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . D: Okay . D: We're doing okay . D: Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . A: Okay . A: Mm . B: Yeah . B: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . A: Mm-hmm . D: True . D: Worth looking into . A: Mm-hmm . B: It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . D: True . A: Okay . D: Yeah . B: So it's just something to consider . A: Okay . A: Absolutely . A: Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . A: Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um . D: Mm . D: Yeah . A: I appear to have lost my microphone . A: Mm . A: Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . A: Um right . A: I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . A: The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . A: Um . A: The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? C: Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . A: Okay . D: Mm . A: Okay . D: Just the casing . C: We could have the casing , the the face plates . A: Okay . B: Back to the uh the cost the material . B: We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? B: That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . D: Mm . A: Mm . B: And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? D: Yeah . B: We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there . D: Right . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Right . B: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . A: Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . D: Mm . D: Right . B: Yeah . D: Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ True . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room . D: True . D: True . C: Uh . A: Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . D: Yeah . D: Oh yeah . C: Sure . A: True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . A: Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? C: Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface ? A: Yeah yeah okay . A: Um Yeah I think that would be best . A: Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . A: With a touch screen for the basic functions . A: Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . A: Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . A: Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . D: True . D: Cause it would have a docking base ? A: Mm-hmm . A: But then again that costs as well . D: Yeah . A: Hmm . C: So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? A: Do they ? C: Those new ones . A: Okay . D: Can we afford that ? B: Can we afford to include one of those ? D: And will somebody buy it if we don't ? A: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . D: Right . A: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know . D: For twelve Euros ? D: It is . D: Fair enough . D: The basics . A: Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . D: Mm . A: Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation . D: Kay . A: Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um and um a small paging function . B: Right . A: Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . A: Just a beep . B: Okay . A: Um right so any comments ? A: Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . B: Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? B: Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . C: Be interesting . D: Mm . B: What what would be on that touch screen ? B: Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said . D: And oh . D: Yeah the the fashion do . C: We put fashion into electronics . D: Yeah . A: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . D: Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and Yeah . A: Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno , what do you guys think ? B: S too much . D: For now . B: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . D: Yeah . D: Nice . B: That'd be okay . C: Yeah . C: Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . D: Um . D: Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . A: Hmm . A: Mm . B: Mm . A: Yeah . B: True . A: Yeah . C: I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . D: Yeah . D: Y Yeah you would think . A: Yeah . A: Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . C: Mm-hmm . A: Jus But apparently not . D: But . D: If it comes from above . B: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . A: So . B: They just want it to be on and ready to go . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Well fair enough . A: Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . A: But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . C: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . A: Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . D: Mm . C: Yep . C: Goes into a sleep mode . A: Okay . A: Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . A: Um . A: Um cool so any last things before we break ? A: Alright . A: Fair enough . D: We're good ? A: Sounds good . A: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . A: I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . C: I've put my files in the shared folder as well . A: Brilliant . D: Yeah . A: That's fab guys . A: Cool .","summary":"The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo. The Project Manager will post the discussion notes and the meeting's minutes to be available to all the participants. The group decided to use plastic as their casing material instead of metal. The marketing will be focused towards the youth market. The group decided to keep the touch screen interface, and to keep the main interface simple. The remote will have a locating device that operates either through voice recognition or through paging. The company logo will appear in a brief flash in the boot-up screen of the device. The group had problems with sacrificing popular features in order to stay within the project budget.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to discuss the design guidelines for a new television remote control. A shared understanding emerged that the remote should focus solely on television functions, incorporate company colors of red and black, and feature the slogan \"we put fashion in electronics.\" The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of using primarily plastic construction to avoid interference issues and potential safety hazards. The User Interface Developer highlighted the need for a universal and user-friendly design, suggesting a balance between complexity and simplicity. The Marketing Analyst presented findings from usability tests, indicating a preference for basic functions and a desire for voice recognition options, especially among younger demographics. The team decided to proceed with a touch screen interface, explore advanced battery technologies, and consider a subtle incorporation of the company slogan in the boot-up screen. Action-items included researching modern plastics for aesthetic value and evaluating the feasibility of voice recognition and locator functions. Financial constraints were considered, with a focus on balancing technological advancements with cost-effectiveness to meet the target price of \u20ac12.50 per unit. The meeting concluded with plans to save and share relevant files for future reference, ensuring alignment on the next steps in the remote control design process.","relevance":0.5494773984,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the company colors that needed to be included in the remote control design?","answer":"Red and black."},{"question":"What slogan did the remote control need to feature?","answer":"We put fashion in electronics."},{"question":"What material did the Industrial Designer suggest primarily using for construction?","answer":"Plastic."},{"question":"What did the Marketing Analyst find regarding user preferences for remote control functions?","answer":"A preference for basic functions and interest in voice recognition options, especially among younger demographics."}]}
{"meeting_id":"ES2009c","dialogue":"D: That went well , thank you . A: That's great . D: Perfect . B: Kay . A: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . A: Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . A: Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . A: In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . A: Um . A: Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . A: Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . A: Um . A: So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . A: And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . A: So , perfect . A: So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . B: I'll go first . D: Go ahead . A: Alright Nathan , take it away . A: It is Nathan right ? A: I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? B: No Nathan's fine . A: Good . B: It's either Nathan or participant two . C: Mister participant two that is . B: Uh . D: Nice . B: Okay . A: Nice . B: Um , basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . A: Mm . B: Um , components of a remote control , okay . B: We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . B: Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . B: Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . B: Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . B: Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . B: So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . A: Hmm . D: Mm . B: So we'll have to look into that . B: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . B: Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . A: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? B: Um , I imagine that we could specify . B: Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . A: Okay , brilliant . B: Yeah . B: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . B: And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . A: Hmm . D: Right . B: Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . D: Right . D: Nice . B: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . B: So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . B: And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . B: Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . A: Hmm . B: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . D: Interesting . B: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . D: Mm . D: Good call . A: M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea . D: Choose it . B: Yeah . B: I am sure that we could do that . B: Um , of course Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . A: Yeah . B: Just to set us apart a little bit . B: Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . B: Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . B: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? C: Interesting question . B: S a bit of a challenge question . A: Mm . D: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? C: Yes . A: Mm . B: Right , that's my concern too . B: Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . B: My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . B: Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . B: So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . D: Right . A: Mm . D: Right . A: Can we do marketing piloting too ? A: Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? D: Um It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay , perfect . A: Great , thank you very much Nathan . D: Temporarily anyway . B: Oh yeah , you're welcome . A: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . D: I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . D: You waiting for me ? A: Fascinating , compelling even . C: Did you ? D: I know , what a teaser ain't it . D: Um . D: Right . D: So current market trends . D: Screen . D: Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . D: Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . D: Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . D: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into . B: Mm . D: Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something Mm-hmm . A: Tomatoes . B: Mm . C: I like it , I like it . B: Hmm . B: I should have mentioned this um . B: As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . C: Yes . D: Mm . D: Might be an interesting way to go . C: Fabulous . A: Slick , slick . D: Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . D: So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . B: Mm . D: Um . A: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Um . D: Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . B: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . A: Mm . D: True . B: Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . D: Very true . A: Yeah , it's like , yep it's ubiquitous isn't it ? D: Very true . B: Taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . D: Very much so . D: Um We could . C: We can have a duck tape casing . D: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot . C: It could go with the granola crowd . D: Ah , it could be , it could be , um . D: Yeah that's what I know . A: Great , thanks for that Sarah . D: No problem . A: Ron ? C: Phew . C: Computer's adjusting . C: One moment please . C: So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . C: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . C: Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . C: Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . C: I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . A: Yeah . C: Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . C: Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . C: Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . C: Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . C: Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . C: Um . C: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control right . D: Mm . A: Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the Mm . D: Yeah . D: Very true , very true . C: Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about . D: Mm . C: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . A: Mm . B: Mm . B: No . C: And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . C: Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . D: Hmm . C: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . A: Yeah , I can see . C: Um , again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . D: Okay . C: Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . D: Mm , right . C: Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . C: Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . A: Mm . D: Mm . C: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready . D: Nice . A: Great . C: And uh that is about it . A: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . A: Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . D: Mm . A: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . B: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . A: Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . A: Um . A: Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? D: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . A: Kay . A: Kay . D: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then right ? A: Mm-hmm . B: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that's just an estimate though . A: To produce each one . D: Per ? D: Piece . C: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . D: I know And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? A: Mm . C: You industrial designers . B: I know . B: It's fun . A: Hmm . A: Well . D: Do we remember ? B: I thought there was some flexibility with that . D: Okay . A: There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . D: Can we justify it ? A: Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . A: If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . D: Right . A: So From the board , um , well That's true , I mean And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . C: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? B: That's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails . B: Right . D: Though I think that's what people would pay for , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something Yeah . B: It is the new it would be in a class of its own . D: Right . D: Yeah . A: Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? C: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh Yeah . D: See if we can cut some corners . D: Right . D: Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . A: Mm . B: It's true . B: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on Yeah . D: Right . D: It's a starting point anyway , so . A: No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . A: Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . D: Mm . C: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already . A: So The voice rec thing , I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec . D: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . D: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . A: Yeah . D: Price-wise . D: True . D: We've already got it . C: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . C: Sounds good . A: Hmm . A: What do you think on it Nathan ? A: About the voice rec ? B: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . D: Pretty much . B: It would be very nice . C: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . D: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . D: Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . A: Mm . D: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . A: Yeah . C: Does having both really up our costs ? A: I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . A: You know , you can't you can't have all three . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . A: It's just impossible . D: Yeah . A: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . A: Um . A: Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . A: What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? D: Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . D: But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . B: I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . A: Kay . A: What does the cost look like Ron ? A: Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? A: Nathan ? C: Well my p is Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . D: Mm . A: Mm . D: Right . A: Right . D: Right . D: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got . A: Mm . D: In a lot other ways too . A: Okay . A: So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . A: Okay . D: I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Sorted . A: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . C: It's you and me outside a little here . D: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? A: Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . B: Yeah . D: Right . D: Okay . B: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? A: Yes . D: Mm-hmm . A: We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . B: Okay . A: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . A: Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? A: Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? B: Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . A: Mm . D: Yeah . B: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to It's true . D: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably Yeah . A: Mm . A: Yep . B: Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . C: Calculator . D: True . D: True . B: Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . D: Right . A: Right . D: Okay . A: Okay . A: What do you think Ron ? C: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . A: Okay . C: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . C: If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . D: Uh Interesting . A: Hmm . B: Hmm . B: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? C: Just a thought . A: Yeah . B: What's the uh idea ? C: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . D: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . B: Hmm . B: Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . D: True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , right . A: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . A: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . D: Mm-hmm . B: Right . D: Yep . D: Yeah . A: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . A: Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . D: With the bu yeah . A: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . B: I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . D: True . D: Way to go . C: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . D: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ? C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: Yeah , those are nice . C: Exactly . A: Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . D: Right . B: Mm . D: That would be kinda neat . D: Terracotta bowl or something . D: Mm . A: Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . A: Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . B: Okay . A: And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . D: Mm . D: Yeah . A: You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . B: Right . B: Just kind of the squishy feel . D: Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . A: Mm 'kay . A: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . A: But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . D: Right . A: Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . D: Handy . A: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , um . A: I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . B: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess . D: Okay . A: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . A: Um . A: And we just yeah go from there . A: Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . D: Mm . D: Right . D: Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be Take precedence , yeah . B: Right . A: Like maybe have menu things . B: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . D: Right . A: Mm . D: And they slide . A: Yes . D: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p True , we're still not making it easier then . C: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . A: Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . B: Yeah . D: True . D: Fair enough . A: B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . D: Yeah . A: Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . A: You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah it's just a scroll . B: Right . D: Yeah . B: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? B: Rubber buttons ? B: Um Right . A: Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um . D: Yeah . D: Probably . C: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . D: Right . D: Mm . D: Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . B: Right . A: Mm 'kay , um . A: We've already kind of covered this as well . A: That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . D: Mm . A: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . D: Right , particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed . A: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Um . A: Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . C: Well what are we actually doing ? C: What were Sure . A: Right . A: I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't ? D: Uh . D: Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah , whatever . A: Oh , my bad um sorry . D: No , don't worry about it . A: The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool ? D: Okay . B: So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? D: Yeah . B: Or are we just going to go with one ? A: Um . B: ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Right . B: It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so There's an idea . A: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . D: Mm . D: Yeah . A: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . C: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme . D: Yeah , get in there . D: Yeah , totally . A: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours . A: But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . A: Cool . A: Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . A: I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . A: Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . B: Right . A: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . A: Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . A: Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . A: Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . A: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . B: Oh excellent yeah . A: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? D: Cool . B: That sounds good . C: Fabulous . A: Alright . A: I guess we'll just hit the bricks . A: Thanks guys . D: Cool .","summary":"The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface. The group then discussed the features of the device. They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. They decided to use solar power to power the device. The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. They discussed using rubber for the case. The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes. The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market, and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype. The Industrial Designer, the User Interface Designer, and the Marketing Expert were instructed to work together on making the prototype of the remote control. The Industrial Designer will build the look of the device using the new manufacturing constraints that were presented. The User Interface Designer was assigned the task of making the design layout of the device. The Marketing Expert was instructed to check the evaluations of the prototype. The group realized that it would be too costly to add both a voice recognition component and a touch screen, so they decided between the two and will now only add the voice recognition component. The group decided to have optional alternative cases for the device to suit different consumer tastes. It was also decided that the remote will not have the traditional look of a hand-held remote since it can be stationary with voice recognition software. The remote control will be made of a soft rubber material. The device will be powered by solar power, with a small backup battery. There were difficulties deciding between adding extra features and staying within the project budget. The participants had problems projecting how much each added feature would drive up the price point of the device because there was a lack of data on manufacturing cost.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting focused on conceptual design, the team, including A (the facilitator), B (Nathan), C (Ron), and D, delved into crucial decisions for their remote control prototype.

A: So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . A: That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . A: Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . A: So . A: That's sorted , back to the main meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . B: Well . B: Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . B: What's to be said about it ? B: Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . B: Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . A: Mm-hmm . B: This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . B: And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . B: But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . B: As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ? D: Ah . A: Nice . D: Fair enough . B: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . A: Perfect . B: Um . C: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will . B: Go ahead . D: Mm . D: Right . D: Appropriate , okay . C: Um . C: Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . D: Mm 'kay . D: It is an option . A: Oh , right . B: That's this here . D: Ah . C: Um . D: I see . C: So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . C: Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . C: Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . C: Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? B: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . B: Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . C: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . B: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , I thought that was kinda nice . A: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . D: Nice . B: This was actually an apple on the inside . D: Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? B: This Yeah . C: Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh polymer yeah . D: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , okay . C: It's fine . B: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but Right . C: Hmm . D: Fair enough . D: No but It's a couple years off at least . C: It's pos a possible new product . D: Okay . C: Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . A: Brilliant . C: Um , did we come in under budget ? B: Uh we did , yeah . B: This cost well to put this into um production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? B: It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . B: Um , so I was quite pleased with that . C: Mm-hmm . B: One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . D: Mm . A: Brilliant . B: So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . D: Mm . D: Okay . C: Mm . C: Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? B: And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? C: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . D: Okay . D: Yeah . C: Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . C: Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . D: Mm 'kay . B: Hmm . B: Yeah . C: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . D: Right . A: Cool . B: Any questions ? A: No , no I think that's Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . D: Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? D: Covers ? D: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? B: Um , do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ? D: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? C: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh . D: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Oh I see , right , um . B: Um , well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean . D: Okay . D: Just veneer really , yeah . C: Right . D: Okay . C: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . D: Mm-hmm . D: And the whole thing Okay . D: Right . C: So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine . D: Yeah . D: There's Okay . C: We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . D: Mm 'kay . D: Okay , very cool . D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Yep . D: It's still an option if we need it . B: Yeah . D: Very cool , nice job . A: I like it , brilliant . A: Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . A: Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . B: Oh . A: Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . B: Ooh . A: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? B: Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , yep . A: With a back-up battery ? A: With the ba okay . A: Um and Clever , clever , well done . C: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . C: Yeah . A: Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? B: Yeah , yeah . B: It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um . A: Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? B: Yeah , mm-hmm . A: Um . A: And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , yeah . B: Yeah , special . B: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? B: Cause it i it is very unconventional , I like to think of it as unconventional . A: Yeah , it's it's quite unique . A: I like it , yeah it's So it looks like a bit over budget , um . D: M come in at sixteen ? B: Oh . B: Huh , doesn't match up does it ? A: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery . B: How do you feel about that ? A: Uh Mm-hmm . C: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . D: Yeah . B: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do ? D: Mm k . A: Mm-hmm . B: People'd be real upset . B: I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . D: True . A: Hmm . A: What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . D: Nah . A: Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um It's either or . B: Yeah . D: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . B: Hmm . C: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right ? D: I mean Which , it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . C: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . B: Right . D: Right . D: Yeah . B: Right . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: I think unfortunately that's our best option . B: I guess we might have to do that . B: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? D: Mm . B: Of twelve fifty . A: Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . B: Yeah , . D: It kind of yeah . C: Savings . D: Mm-mm . A: Um . A: So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . D: Yeah . A: So that would be the it's a major change but Yeah . B: Gotta do what you gotta do . A: Alright , so we're in agreement on that . D: Unfortunately I think we are . C: No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . A: Right . A: Moving along swiftly . A: Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . D: That would be me . D: Um cord ? A: Ah of course , sorry . D: No problem . A: Whoosh . D: Can you reach , that would be great , thank you . C: Yep . A: That'd be great Brilliant . D: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn . D: Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . D: Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? D: Is the design what we wanted it to do ? D: I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? D: Um . D: Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? D: Does it respond to voice recognition ? D: And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . B: Mm . D: Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . D: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . B: Really good . D: So . C: They like that spongy feel . D: Yeah . D: It looks like it's going over well , so we're we're good yeah . C: And the paging function works well , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one . B: Six ? B: We did . D: Yeah . D: It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . B: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay . D: That's everything from me . A: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: Mm . D: Yeah , it is a set-back , but Okay , do you need the cord back ? C: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're I guess that's true . A: Um yeah , I was just go on . B: I know . A: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? B: True . A: Right . A: So , um , this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . A: I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . A: Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report . A: So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . B: Okay . D: As in within the team or ? A: I think so yeah . B: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 'Kay . D: Okay . A: I think it's I mm-hmm , I think so . A: I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment . D: It is now , you're in charge so there you go . A: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . B: Yeah . D: Whatever . A: Um right , um so any thoughts ? B: Are we considering these points here ? D: Um . A: Yeah . B: Okay . D: I think they're starting blocks yeah . A: What do you guys feel about the process ? D: Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . C: We didn't use the whiteboard at all . B: No . A: No , no whiteboard . D: No , we didn't . D: We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . C: And Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . D: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . B: Yeah , it's true . C: Uh . B: Mm . A: Was pretty cool tack though . C: Yeah . D: Mm . B: Definitely . D: I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . B: As you write your personal coach . D: Yeah , but I didn't get a response so we'll see . B: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? D: Okay that would be kinda creepy . B: That'd be weird . A: Attempts to contact coach ineffective . D: Well what kind of coaching is that really ? D: What if I really needed something . C: I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . D: I think so . D: And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . B: Yeah . C: With the natural look . B: That's very natural . A: Very natural look . D: Organic , really . A: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . D: And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . D: Mm yeah , I'm impressed . C: I think the teamwork was good as well . B: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . D: Nice . D: All four of those little containers . B: Yeah , I guess My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough . A: Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . D: Yeah . D: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . B: I know it could have been amazing . D: Oh well . A: What did you guys think about the the the roles ? B: Hmm . D: They were good . B: Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . D: Yeah . D: True . B: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , which was kind of fun . D: Do your own . D: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . B: Yeah . D: I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . A: That's true , I I got this spreadsheet . D: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , like that was it . D: So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . C: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , which was fine . D: Whatever . A: Of what to do . B: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . B: You know Yeah . D: Mm . D: Yes . A: Mm , mm . D: Hmm , very much so . B: Yeah . B: That was fun . B: I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . D: Very much so . A: Cool . C: And I think your leadership was quite good . B: It was really good yeah . D: Hmm . A: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . D: Yeah . D: That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . A: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . B: It's kinda fun . A: I dunno . C: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? A: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . A: I usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , you know ? D: Hmm . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Little different . A: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that I could only imagine . B: Yeah . C: I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . A: Yeah , yeah . A: Maybe in in Legos you know ? C: Possibly . A: Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever . C: Oh yeah , still have 'em . D: Yeah . D: Totally . A: Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? B: Yeah ? D: I think so . C: Yep . A: Hmm . B: You don't . A: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't I I was just I It's true huh ? D: Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . B: Yeah . D: That's true . A: Yeah . A: Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . A: It d But yeah . D: Yeah that is kind of Mine was the mics . A: Interesting . A: It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? A: I mean the whole process of I don't know . B: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? A: I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mm . D: I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . B: Yeah , that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . D: True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . A: Nor I . C: I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . D: True . C: Um , because I've got this laptop . D: Yeah . C: Standard , I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me . D: Yeah . A: I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . D: Well it looks really professional . A: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . D: I know . B: Yeah , that's it . A: I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . B: Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because New ideas . D: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . D: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . A: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . A: You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here . C: So is this all we need to get through ? A: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . D: I guess . D: Um . D: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? C: Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? A: Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , mm-hmm . D: That slide was like that ? A: I didn't change this one at all . B: Hmm . D: Well . A: Um ch Yeah well . B: I guess we're on the right track . A: W I kinda like th Yeah you can't Yeah . B: No , none . D: Uh I think they still do their job . B: I think they're fine actually . D: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form I don't Yeah . B: Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . A: Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? A: It's like inventing a new car . A: Yeah yeah , you can Yeah . D: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , you know ? D: Don't know . A: Hmm . A: Um . C: What is that ? A: Kay . C: Our limited ability to think outside the box ? D: Kind of . A: So this was other costs . B: Are we back into project mood ? A: I dunno . A: I think this is forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . D: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? D: How much time do we have left ? A: I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . A: Like , what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is Yep . D: Mm . D: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away . B: Yeah . C: Why ? A: Hey . C: Huh I think it was the real . D: You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . D: Mm-hmm . D: Whatever . A: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . B: Yeah . D: Very much , yeah . A: I actually didn't do that at all though , every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . B: Mm-hmm . A: I di Oh . C: Oh I added like five slides too , but I Yeah , mine too . D: See I only got blank ones . B: Did you really ? B: I just got blank ones and Me too . A: What ? A: Really ? D: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty . A: Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this ? A: Like with this was what it looks like . D: Like with those words already on it ? A: This is what that looked like , literally , just like that . D: No . C: No . A: Interesting . D: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . A: Uh-huh huh huh . B: I deleted slides . D: I think I added a slide one time . C: I added many slides every time Yeah . D: Hey with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . B: That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . D: Mm . C: Um . A: Interesting . A: Any other thoughts come to mind ? D: I wanna know how our product would fare . D: I can't just leave it there . B: I think it would fail , I think it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . D: I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . D: But you know the whole Yeah . C: Even you . B: I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . D: I know it is . A: Yeah but Builds . B: It's a happy face . C: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications . D: Mm . A: Mm . C: I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed . D: I I noticed that . D: By accident . A: Interesting . D: Well huh . D: An interesting day all in all I would say . A: Uh , yeah , I'd say so . B: Yeah , it's uh I wanna see a Yeah . C: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . D: I know . A: Mm , I know . C: Mm . A: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . D: I Yeah . A: You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . A: Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . D: Cause it's such a functional item . A: You know , maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea . A: And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , I dunno . D: Mm . A: But . B: Hmm . A: All in all it's kinda interesting . D: Mm . B: So we have more slides or ? A: No just this closing one . A: No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches and Mm . D: We got it to be . D: Like cutting corners . D: Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . B: Mm . D: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . A: True . A: Yeah . A: Cause we di we had a thu think about it . A: Um . A: Yeah . A: And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . A: Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . D: Yay . B: Hmm . B: I It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . D: Make it sound eloquent . D: Oh , I have to done I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing . A: Nice . A: Oh yeah . A: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . C: What the uhs and the Mm . B: Really . D: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . B: Filler words or ? A: Yep , they're called um disfluencies . D: Yeah . B: Disfluencies . D: That's a good word for it . A: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . D: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . A: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents . B: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , like c come on gimme something . D: I , yeah , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . A: Yeah . A: Oh yeah . A: Yeah I know . A: Come on give me some information . A: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . D: Yeah , we are addicts . C: That's scary yeah ? B: It is scary . D: Mm . C: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . A: It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? D: Yeah . A: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . D: I yeah . D: True . A: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous Mm . D: I yeah . B: Yeah . D: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . B: It's crazy . D: Uh-huh . B: So Should . C: In the eighties ? D: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . D: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him . C: Right . C: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . C: You guys ready to celebrate ? A: Yeah that's our last step . D: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? A: Celebration . D: I think so . A: Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . D: I think that's a closer . A: Cool . B: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? B: this has been long enough . C: Celebrate . A: Where do you find that ? D: I have no idea . B: Is that the only song you have ? C: There is another one . A: Is this one of those media player ? C: Huh ? C: Yep . A: W oh . B: That's awesome . A: The default track . B: Maybe I have a different one . A: I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . A: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . D: So is that a close ? A: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . D: Okay , that's the end of the meeting . A: Fab . D: Thank you gentlemen . D: I feel like I'm signing off .","summary":"The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen, to hide the complicated features, and to start building the prototype). The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition, interchangeable cases, visible light, and a soft casing material. The Project Manager presented what each component cost, which showed that the project was going over the alotted budget; the group decided to remove the solar panel. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype and showed that the prototype had met many of the initial goals. The group then evaluated the project process and discussed their effectiveness as a group. The Project Manager summarized the proceedings of the meeting which will go into a final report, along with comments made during the project evaluation. The Project Manager will create a final report containing the summary of the meeting proceedings, including the evaluation of the project process. The group decided to remove the solar panel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original goal. The designers of the prototype decided to use several different colors in the visible light stream in the device. They also decided to use classic rubber buttons instead of more costly scroll buttons. The group encountered a problem with a lack of information about their specific tasks. They also felt it difficult to bring creativity to the project because of the budget constraints.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the detailed design meeting, the team, including A, B, C, and D, gathered to review the prototype for a new remote control with voice recognition capabilities. The meeting delved into the previous meeting's minutes, highlighting the need for a remote with a non-traditional shape and voice recognition features. The team showcased the assembled prototype, emphasizing large buttons for primary functions and a slide-out panel for advanced features.

A: And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . D: Yep . B: Yep . A: Alright . A: Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint . A: I wonder what button I press ? C: Just do it on the arrow . A: Yeah , or how about I just click ? A: Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . A: Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . A: We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . A: Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . A: Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . A: Okay , here is our project . A: We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . A: And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . A: And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . A: Same thing with conceptual design . A: Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . A: That's pretty much the the whole process for today . A: And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . A: Okay . A: Alright . A: First we're gonna start off by using our tools . A: And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . B: I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . D: We could Yeah , we could on here . A: Alright , let's go forward then . A: Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . A: Even if you are not a good drawer like me . A: Alright . B: Artistic skills , nil . C: Fine . A: Um . A: Bless you . D: Oh , thanks . B: I draw like I'm in grade five . A: Oh do I . A: Kay , about one more minute . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: And who would like to start us off ? D: I'll go . A: Alright . D: Um this is my picture . D: I drew fish I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . D: It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . D: Yeah . A: Only if they're piranhas . D: Yeah , they they're easy , you know . D: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Who wants to go next ? B: I'll go . B: I drew a kitty . B: It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . D: No I I see it . C: No , I kne I knew . A: No , it looks like a cat . D: Yeah , it does look like a cat . B: I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . A: I love cats , too . C: Yeah . A: I'm a cat person . D: I'm allergic to cats . C: Ah . A: Uh . B: I'm allergic to cats , too . D: Oh , okay . A: If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , it's weird . C: In my next life . D: Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . B: I still can't sleep with them in my room . A: Okay . D: It was crazy . D: Yeah . A: Okay , Fenella ? C: Um , I drew a badger . D: Cool . B: Yay . A: Badger . C: Well , yeah . A: Good choice . A: Why a badger ? C: Uh I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and Well , a little bit like the Yes . B: Are you trying to suggest something ? C: Um . C: And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . D: Oh , okay . C: Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian . C: He's Liverpudlian writer . A: Alright . C: Um , that kind of books . C: Badgers are cool in that one too . A: Okay . A: And I'm last . A: Kay . A: Look at my sad sad giraffe . D: No , that's good . A: No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . A: I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . A: They're just such odd creatures , you know . A: I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . A: I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . A: Only seen a couple in zoos . D: You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em Right . A: Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . A: Okay . A: Alright . A: Guess we're getting straight back into business here . A: Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . A: We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . A: And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . A: Okay . A: So we're gonna talk for a little while . A: Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . A: Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . A: So . C: Now ? A: Yeah . A: You wanna start us off ? A: Anybody have anything to offer ? B: Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? A: Right . B: One remote for everything . C: And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ? B: Um . B: I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . D: Yeah , TiVo . A: TiVo . C: But it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know . B: Okay . D: It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . A: They're never universal . A: That's right . A: Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Something from Sam's club . B: So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . A: Yeah . D: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . A: Yeah . A: Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . A: If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . A: They want the ergonomic ones . D: They want like the flashy lights . A: Yeah . D: Oh like this came from Las Vegas . A: Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . C: But at the same time are simple . D: Mm yeah . A: Right . A: So that people like my mother can use it . B: What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? A: Yeah . A: Kay . A: Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah . C: Just bad ones . A: That's true . C: Um . B: What kinda battery would we want to use ? B: Because battery changing is usually Okay . C: D Double A_ . D: Double A_ . A: Do some of them use triple A_s though ? D: Yeah some use triple A_s . C: Some but Yeah , I guess then it's If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . D: So double or triple ? A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Yeah . A: But that has to do with the size of it too . C: Right . B: Yeah . A: Well , w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A . D: Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . B: Can you with a small lithium battery ? A: But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . A: Hey . A: Anything else ? A: Alright . A: Moving along . A: Oh , we're closing the meeting . A: Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . A: Here's what we're going to do . A: Um the I_D_ , which is who ? A: Okay , you're going to think about the working design . A: What do you think that means ? A: Okay . A: And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . A: I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . A: Right ? D: Right . A: I would think so . A: Okay . A: And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . A: Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? A: Okay . A: This meeting is officially over .","summary":"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole.

{"meeting_id":"ES2010b","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Um welcome to our second meeting . A: This is the functional design meeting . A: And I hope you all had a good individual working time . A: Okay , let's get started . A: Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . A: After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . A: And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . A: Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . A: Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . A: And then we're gonna close up the meeting . A: And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . A: Okay . A: First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . A: First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . A: And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . A: And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . A: Kay . A: Oh , well let's go ahead and , back , previous . A: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . A: Who would like to start us off ? C: I don't mind going first . A: Kay . A: Okay . A: Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? C: Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . A: Okay . D: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or I can go . C: You know you could you could do it yourself actually . A: Oh . B: Did you send it ? A: Save it in the project documents . C: Put it in Project Documents , yeah . A: Okay . A: Mm-mm-mm . A: This one ? C: Sure . A: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Okay . C: Okay . B: Great . C: Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . C: Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . C: And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . C: And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . C: And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . C: And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . A: Okay . A: Okay . C: These are two examples . C: Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . C: And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . C: So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . A: Right . C: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . C: So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . C: Okay . A: Ready . C: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? C: And what functions it needs to complete . C: Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . C: So that's it . A: Alright . A: Very good presentation . A: Thank you . A: You speak with such authority on the matter . C: Mm . A: Okay . C: Left . A: Who would like to um follow that one up ? A: Now , that we've discussed Okay . A: Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay . D: Yeah , you should run it . A: Functional requirements . D: Mm yes . A: Kay . A: Alright . A: Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . D: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . D: Seventy five percent think they're ugly . D: Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . D: So that's really what we need to do . C: Wait . D: And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . D: So Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . C: And that meaning what ? C: Okay . D: Yeah . D: I don't know . D: It's from my uh research . C: Right . A: Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . D: My team wasn't very clear . C: Only use ten percent of the buttons . D: That's okay . A: What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . D: I I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . A: Okay . A: Oh , right . A: The buttons . A: Okay . A: Yeah . A: Okay . B: We only use ten per cent of our brains . D: Good point . A: It works . D: It's a necessary evil . B: yeah . A: Ready for the next slide ? D: Mm-hmm . D: And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . A: Hmm . C: Lost . C: S Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? A: It's okay . A: It's very important . D: Yes , it is important for the remote control world . D: Sh Uh possibly . A: Could be , yeah . B: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? C: Like Channel , volume , power . A: Oh . D: Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I don't know . A: I think that's a pretty good guess though . D: Yeah , I would assume so . D: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . C: It's like if you're holding it to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . A: Yeah . D: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . A: It's okay . A: Okay . A: Next slide ? D: Yes . D: And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . D: So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . A: User-friendly . D: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . D: Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . D: And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . D: So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . D: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . A: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? D: I guess so , yeah . A: Okay . D: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . A: Oh , that'd be lovely . C: Yeah . A: Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it Mm . C: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . A: Oh , yeah , that's true . C: You know like go to the base . A: We could definitely include that if we wanted to . C: Yeah . A: If it's within our price . A: Okay . A: Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? B: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it . A: Okay . B: Kay . B: I think it should be there , working design . C: Working design . A: There we go . A: Kay . B: Kay . B: Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . A: Oh my bad . D: Oh that's fine . B: Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . C: Help me . B: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . B: Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . B: Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . D: What exactly is a smart chip ? B: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . C: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? C: Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? B: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . C: Mm-hmm . B: And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . A: Okay . A: Ready ? B: Um yep , nothing here . A: That's okay . B: Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . B: Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . B: Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . B: Um a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . A: Hmm . B: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . B: Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . B: Uh this is my fifty second design . B: Power source over here . B: We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . B: Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . B: Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . D: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? B: This is just like a rough schematic . A: So this would be the front ? B: So this is the internal workings . A: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? D: Oh okay . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . A: Okay . A: The l the light up kind of Yeah . D: Like that we know the battery's working . B: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? A: Hmm . D: Okay . A: It'd probably be lighting up the key too , right ? B: We can skip that whole thing . B: Yep . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Kay . B: So you can put it in the dark . A: The buttons . D: Yeah , and that's good . D: We should make it glow in the dark . A: Okay . A: Yeah , definitely . A: Kay nex R Ready ? B: Yeah , that's it . A: Kay , any p 'Kay ? D: Mm 'kay . A: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . B: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . A: Anything else ? C: Just Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . A: Okay . C: So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? D: I think we should . D: Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . D: I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . A: Mm . C: Ovals . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . A: Wait , come back . A: Alright . A: Sorry , let's go through this . A: Alright . A: Here we go . A: New product requirements . A: First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . A: We're trying not to over-complicate things . A: So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . B: Okay . A: It's not gonna be multi-functional . A: Hey . A: And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . A: We're trying to get our name out there in the world . A: Okay . A: And you know what teletext is ? C: Yeah . A: in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even Yeah , just black with just text . C: I know . D: What is it ? C: Yeah , it's like black , black and white kind of It'll give you the sports . D: Like running along the bottom ? A: Yeah . B: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so It's the entire screen is just running information at random . D: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? A: Kind of . C: Except the entire screen . A: Yeah it's the whole screen . C: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like Yeah . A: So anyway Right . B: Seemingly . D: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? A: Right . A: But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . A: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . D: Okay . B: Okay . B: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? A: Alright . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yes . A: It's part of the logo . A: Okay . C: Company colour being yellow . A: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . A: So . A: Alright . A: Whatever . A: Okay . A: So our target group is You mentioned um older people ? C: Mm-hmm . A: Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? A: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . C: It's gonna make it nicer . C: Yeah . A: I mean they want something user-friendly , so Yeah . B: Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . A: Yeah . A: Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? A: Or kids ? D: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . B: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . D: They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . A: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? D: Yeah , I think we need it all . D: Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . C: We should go for the lowest denominator . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Right , okay . C: High school educated . A: So so they need no technical experience to operate Okay . B: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . A: And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . A: So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . A: So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . C: Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . A: Mm-hmm , volume . D: And channel . D: Yeah . D: Those are the most important ones . A: Right . A: And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . A: Correct , because people only use ten percent . D: Yeah . A: Kay . A: Hey , what else ? C: Um . A: Um . B: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? A: I think so . A: What do you A finding kind of device or Yeah , ho homing device . D: Sure , yeah . B: And like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? D: I need we we need a like homing device . C: Oh right yeah okay . A: Mm 'kay . C: Tracking . D: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . A: Okay . A: Right . B: What if we gave it a charger ? B: And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . C: But you got a base . D: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? D: Because Yeah . B: It's useful for the remote phone . A: Hmm . A: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? D: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . A: Right . C: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . B: Yeah . D: Hmm . B: Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: I I think we can make a decision about that later . A: Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . A: So that would include battery source Power source rather . A: Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? A: And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . D: Right . D: Do w Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . C: Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . A: Mm . A: You could um we could hook it up . A: Oh . D: So basically older people don't really care . D: It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . D: I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . A: Mm-hmm . D: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff . C: Well Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . A: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has Right . D: Right . D: So Right . A: Yeah . A: and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . A: If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . A: A certain phrase then it could beep . A: I dunno . A: Just throwing it out there . D: Yeah . A: Well Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? C: Still fifteen minutes . C: Um . C: Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? C: Can we conceive of leaving them out ? A: Um . D: Wait , on the remote itself ? C: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . D: Well , we definitely need those . A: How how , yeah , how would you leave those out ? B: Yeah . C: Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can like well I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? A: Unless you could say the channel . B: I think people would find that too foreign . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , that's true . D: You definitely need Wait . A: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . A: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . A: So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . B: It's when we get satellite . A: Mm . A: get your own remote , or digital cable . B: Yeah . A: Kay . A: Um . A: I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . A: Um . B: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so R_ the double R_ . A: Kay . A: And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . C: The colour being yellow ? A: I'm guessing . C: And how do we Can't make it entirely Well if you have like a Hang on . D: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . A: And the R_R_ . A: We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys . B: Or is the l Yeah , yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge . D: Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . D: Yeah . C: If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . A: Right . A: So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , or no menu buttons . C: Right , yeah . D: Yeah . A: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything . C: Two examples . C: Yeah . A: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? C: Oh , it's a Yeah . A: Okay . D: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? A: The T_V_ . A: I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . A: I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? C: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . A: Hmm . D: Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . C: and so it's like I don't well , I don't know . D: It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . A: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , you know ? C: Right . D: So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . C: Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . A: For the menus . B: Mm-hmm . A: That's true . D: Yeah , okay . C: Channel is just up and down . D: Okay , yeah . C: And then add a Yeah . A: Something that looks mayb you know . D: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . A: Y right , right right right . A: That one ? C: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu . A: Right . A: In the middle perhaps . A: Yep . D: Ooh , I just got an idea for a design . A: good . A: Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? B: I had something , but I forgot . A: Okay . A: get out of here . A: Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . A: Mm . A: Alright . A: After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . A: And then we're gonna have lunch break . A: And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . A: Um I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . A: And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . A: Um here's what we're each going to do . A: The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . A: Kay . A: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . A: And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? A: No ? A: Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . A: Thank you all .","summary":"The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed the designs of two existing products, showing an example of the simple design that the group wants to implement. The Marketing Expert presented feedback from users, showing that users want a simple but fancy-looking remote control and that young users want speech recognition. She discussed including only the most basic functions in the interface. The Industrial Designer presented her internal design of the device and discussed the processor chip and the energy sources that will be integrated. She suggested integrating an extra lightbulb that lit up when the remote was communicating with the television. The Project Manager gave the group new requirements for the product design. The group discussed marketing the product to a wide range of customers. They had a discussion about possibly including a locator function and speech recognition. They discussed integrating the company's yellow color and logo into the design, and decreasing the number of buttons in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the components concept, the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface concept, and the Marketing Expert to prepare a trendwatching report. The Industrial Designer will prepare the components concept for the device. The User Interface Designer will prepare the interface concept for the device. The Marketing Expert will prepare a trendwatching report. The remote will feature a smart processor chip to accomodate all of the remote's functions. The remote will feature an extra lightbulb that will light up when the remote is communicating with the television. The interface will contain larger buttons. The device will be marketed to all age groups, and made simple for those with less technical skills. The remote will feature mainly basic functions, such as channel changing and volume adjustments, so that the interface will have less buttons. There will be no buttons for controlling a VCR or other device; the interface will feature only channel and volume up\/down buttons, a number pad, and a menu button to access the menu functions on a television. The remote will include the company color and logo in its design. The group will consider including speech recognition and a locator function in the functional design.

{"meeting_id":"ES2010c","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Hi Team . A: Hope you had a good lunch . A: Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . A: Um let's get started . A: Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . A: Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . A: We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . A: And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . A: And we have forty minutes again . A: Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . A: Okay . A: Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . A: Who would like to go first ? B: Just trying to move mine right now . A: Okay . A: Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Trend watching ? D: Yeah . A: Kay . D: Okay , so trend watching . D: Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . D: So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . D: So what they want . D: Right now customers want fancy versus functional . D: Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . D: So the customer basically is confused . D: They don't know exactly what they want . D: They want us to tell them . B: They want everything , but simply . D: Yes . D: Exactly . B: Okay . D: So we can go to next . A: Mm 'kay . D: Okay . D: So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . D: So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . D: I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . A: Mm . A: Mm . D: I mean do you guys know what I mean . A: Right . B: Yeah th I I can I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation . A: Yes . D: Yeah . D: Um . D: But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , because Yeah . A: Right . A: Right . A: People don't buy a new remote every so often . D: I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . D: Okay . D: Awesome . A: Okay . D: Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . D: Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . D: Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . D: Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . D: That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . D: And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . D: Actually right here . D: So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . D: Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . D: So it's classically retro . A: Hmm . D: So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . A: Very good . A: I like it . A: Okay , ready for the next slide ? D: And , yep . D: And that's it . A: Op mm 'kay . B: Okay . A: Great . A: Great presentation . A: Ready ? C: Okay hang on . A: Kay . C: See if it's there . A: Which one is it ? C: I don't know . C: Hang on . C: Interface concepts , no ? A: Interface concepts new . C: Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . A: Y 'Kay . C: Hang on . B: Mine will always read copy of something or other . A: Sorry ? B: I I copied mine before I sent it over . A: Oh okay . C: Sorry , hang on . C: Don't know . A: Oh there we go . C: Okay . C: Okay , um looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . C: Uh if you wanna start the next slide . A: Sure . C: Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . C: And then also there's the idea of the base . C: That's sort of like an idea there . C: And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . C: It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . C: So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but Anyway , next . A: Mm 'kay . C: Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . C: You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . C: And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . C: What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . A: Mm . C: And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . C: Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . A: Mm . C: Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . C: And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . C: So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . A: Okay . C: Okay . C: Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . C: Um this is particularly geared towards children . D: That's cute . C: Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . C: Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . C: Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , uh keep them away from other channels . C: So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . A: Okay . C: You have the wider section for the main controls there . C: Uh you could see how many buttons there are . C: And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . C: On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . C: Um . C: So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . A: Kay . C: And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . C: None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . A: No . C: But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . A: Mm . A: Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . C: Right . D: I have four of those remotes . A: Good lord . A: Okay . A: Ready ? C: That's it . A: Oh , yeah . A: Okay . A: Great job . B: Okay , my turn . A: Okay . D: Okay . B: Whoo . A: What's the title ? B: It'll be copy of component design . A: Got it . B: Yeah . B: Th that looks like it . B: Kay . B: So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . B: So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . B: Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . B: So that being said Next slide , please . B: Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . B: Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . B: An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . B: Next slide , please . B: Thank you . B: Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . B: Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . B: Next slide , please . B: Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . B: They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . B: Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . B: So next slide , please . A: Hmm . A: Interesting . B: Suggested casing options . B: Okay . B: We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . B: Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . B: I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters Yeah . D: That would be amazing , though , yeah . D: No , splinters would What is that ? B: Um certain restrictions do apply here though . B: Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . B: So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . B: Double-curved , you can't do titanium . B: Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . A: Mm . D: Mm . B: Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . B: And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . C: Right . B: I think I have one more slide . A: Kay . B: No , I didn't . A: No , okay . B: Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . B: Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . B: So depends on what we decide we wanna do . B: In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . B: So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . B: But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . A: Mm . D: Right . D: Okay . A: Hmm . B: And that's all I got . A: Okay . A: Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . A: Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions . A: Where were we ? C: Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . A: Sure . C: Um . D: Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . C: Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . C: So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . A: Mm . A: Right . D: Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . A: Right . D: So that way the remote reads it . C: Right , so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . C: So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say . A: Mm . D: I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it , but Technology . A: Hmm . A: Programme . A: If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology Hmm . B: Well , we are making the chip . B: So , I mean But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . D: And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , the better it'll sell . B: Yeah . A: Mm . B: Yeah . B: I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . A: Hmm . B: So that we could reduce cost . D: Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . B: Yeah . A: Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . B: Okay . A: Um . A: Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? D: Oh the base , yeah . A: The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? B: I think the p That's true . C: I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before 'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up Right . A: Hmm . A: Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . D: W We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly It could be like this . A: It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . A: What size battery and Right . C: Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . D: Yes . D: I'd , well uh This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , because But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . C: Are you gonna lose it easier ? D: So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . B: If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . C: Yeah . B: So Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact Mm yeah . D: Hmm . C: So i That's the other thing , it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? D: Two double A_s , for this size . C: But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . D: Right . A: I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy . D: Yeah . C: So we sh Yeah . D: Smaller , without Yeah . A: Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? A: You wanna vote ? D: I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . A: I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base . B: Yeah . C: I'm a away from the base . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Kay so The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . A: That just seems so clunky and Okay . D: Yeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , yeah Oh . C: Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . C: You're kidding . B: You know it happens . A: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: I've had three watches go that way too . C: Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone . D: Ouch . D: A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . A: Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? B: Pieces everywhere . B: Well , we have lots of options . B: I don't think wood is a viable option . D: Yeah wood . A: No . C: Well , titanium s I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that . A: Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead . D: Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . A: Right . B: However , well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right ? A: What would you recommend ? D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , make them a rarity so to speak . C: That'll Yeah , exactly . A: Mm . C: The selling point , yeah . D: We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if Good plan . C: Are we restricted by this ? B: Yeah . B: Well the original Okay . A: I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes . C: Twenty five Euros So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? A: If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . B: Yeah . B: Good plan . A: Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? B: Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . A: Hmm . B: We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know They could come back . D: Oh . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: Yeah , who knows . A: Okay . D: O or we could like take off this . A: They could buy cases , maybe , if they wanted . B: And buy the extra case . C: Okay . A: I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . B: So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . D: Yeah . C: The what the top face , right ? D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay . D: Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . D: That's in . D: Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . A: Right . A: Right . A: Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? B: How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . C: Yeah . A: I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . C: A tracker , yeah . A: could we Yeah . D: Cause that uh what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . A: Hmm . A: Right . D: So uh Ooh . D: Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . C: Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . B: Yeah , see that would just irritate me . C: And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . A: Oh dear . D: Oh , then maybe voice maybe voice activation won't be good . C: So it became highly irritating . A: Okay . B: So I think having a key-phrase is much better . A: Okay . A: Alright . A: But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? D: Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . C: But then it Hmm . A: Just a Okay , alright . B: No . C: Okay . D: But do can your can the department make Oh , brilliant then . B: That would be like a mid-class um Yeah . B: So we don't actually have to go for Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . B: Why not introduce it in this way ? A: No . D: Yeah , good point . A: Mm 'kay . A: Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? D: I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . A: Two ? A: Could it run off of two They're more expensive though , too . D: I mean more more come in a package . C: Well , that depends on what the energy is needed . D: Yeah . B: I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? B: So they're more widely available now . B: And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . B: But if you only have to replace it every five years . A: Mm . D: That's a good point . A: Thoughts anybody ? C: As long as we sell it with it . B: Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . C: Right , that's what I meant . D: We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . A: Okay . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: We still have one more meeting . A: Alright . A: Okay . A: So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design . C: What's it gonna Yeah , what's it gonna look like . A: Okay . C: Um . A: I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? A: It might be the four way scroll , too . D: Yeah , it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . A: I mean if Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? A: Mm . D: Oh , that's true . D: Good point . B: In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Oh , I see what you mean . A: I think so . D: So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? A: Yeah , I like that . A: Kay . D: But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . A: Mm . D: Yeah , like on the side of it . B: Well , if it's just up and down Volume or channel . D: Oh if it's just up and down . C: But is that for Which ? B: I don't know . D: Well , you could do some on both sides . C: Do we have both sides ? A: Can we ? B: Mm yeah . B: We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . D: Yeah . A: So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan Mm . D: That's squishy . D: That's squishy . C: Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . D: have buttons . B: Okay . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , that . A: Hmm . A: Kay any other ideas ? C: Um what colour ? A: Oh , yeah . A: Latex covers . B: We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . A: W I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . C: Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . D: Yeah . C: And that's at the bottom of it . C: Which button ? A: Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? A: Every cover ? B: Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . A: Yeah . B: So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . A: If we want it to be visible and Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? C: Yeah . A: But those are plastic , right ? C: Yeah . A: They're not titanium . A: I kind of like that look . A: Uh but , or if it was really Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . B: For our base one ? D: Yeah , or like a gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . A: What are your thoughts ? A: Gun-metal gray . A: There you go , gun-metal gray . C: I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . A: Why ? B: It'll wear off . C: What's the button Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? D: Yeah , buttons wear off . A: Mm . C: I guess . C: Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . A: Right . D: Hmm . B: There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . D: But we want it to be seen . A: On the back ? C: But you don't But uh , yeah , you don't see it . A: It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . D: We need it to be seen . C: Well , hang on . C: The other option is , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if Yeah , it's like the second to last slide . A: I can find it again . A: Okay . A: And yours was called Interface Concept ? C: Interface , yeah . A: This one ? C: Yeah . A: Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . C: Um . C: Okay , it's the very right one . C: You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . C: It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . A: Mm . C: And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . A: Okay , yes yes . C: If c you envisioning it ? C: And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . A: Okay . C: Hmm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Like a little cut-out kind of Okay . B: Yeah . C: Right . C: That's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . D: Right . C: And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? D: Yeah . D: Some of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . A: Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? D: Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . A: Mm . D: Well , kind of . A: Mm . D: Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . C: Yellow . A: Yellow , I like that idea . C: Yeah . D: Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . A: Mm . D: Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . A: Mm . D: So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . C: Oh , that one . A: I like the yellow illumination idea , very good . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Any other ideas or thoughts ? A: We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so 'Kay . C: Um . C: Ha hang on Let me catch up . D: Mm yeah . C: Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ? A: I think there will be time for that later . A: I'm guessing . A: Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . A: Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . A: The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . A: I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ? C: Yeah . A: I guess . A: Kay . A: And you're gonna do some product evaluation . A: Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . B: Great . C: Fun . B: Play Doh . A: Yeah . A: Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . A: Alright . A: Well , thank you for a very productive meeting . B: Wonderful Ooh .","summary":"The Marketing Expert presented more information on user requirements which showed that users wanted the look of a high-tech device that was still simple to use. She presented the fruit and vegetable fashion trend that the group will integrate into their design. The User Interface Designer presented several ideas for the interface design taken from existing product designs. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and presented options for energy sources and materials. The User Interface Designer also presented the sample speaker technology recently developed by the company. The group had a discussion to finalize the prototype features. It was decided that the device will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand. Voice recognition will not be included outside of the locator function. It will be covered by interchangeable latex casings. To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through the latex casings. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to build the prototype, with the User Interface Designer deciding which buttons will be included. The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to build the prototype; the User Interface Designer will decide which buttons will be included and the Industrial Designer will focus on the look and the materials. The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation. There will be only one design of the remote rather than producing it in several different materials. The remote will be covered by a soft latex casing that can be changed. The device be small and compact and will feature a locator function that uses voice recognition. Voice recognition will not be incorporated for other functions. To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through a cutout in the latex casing. Several of the features that the group had wanted to include were no longer possible due to time and cost restraints, or constraints from the materials themselves.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the conceptual design meeting, the Project Manager led the team through presentations by Courtney, who highlighted customer preferences for fashionable yet functional electronics, and proposed a retro design with large, easy-to-read buttons.

{"meeting_id":"ES2010d","dialogue":"D: I wanna find our if our remote works . A: Me too . D: Oh . A: Okay . D: Whoohoo . A: Um here's the agenda for our last meeting . A: Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . A: Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . A: Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation . B: Mm 'kay , you ready ? C: Um sure . C: You or me ? B: Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . C: Okay . C: Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . B: I'll be the Vanna . C: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . C: Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . C: Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . A: Right . C: Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . C: Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . A: Hmm . C: It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . D: That's nice . A: Yeah . C: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . D: Good . C: Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . C: Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . A: Great . C: And then on the side you have the buttons . C: They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . A: Okay . C: I don't think they're scrolling . B: No . B: They're just buttons . C: Right , yeah . C: And then yeah , the buttons . B: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . D: Yeah . B: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . D: Yeah . B: Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . C: Thumb-shaped . C: Yeah . C: And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . A: Okay . A: And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? B: I'd say a single . A: Single . C: Single . A: Single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . D: Yeah . C: Right . B: Yeah , it's only actually the size of my hand . A: Great . A: Great . A: I think you did an awesome job . D: Yeah , I think it's a beautiful Yeah . A: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . D: Good job , you guys . A: Good job . C: Oh thank you . B: Whoohoo . D: Those are really good . A: Alright what's next in our agenda ? A: Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney . D: Okay , it's a PowerPoint presentation . D: I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . D: It's under evaluation . A: Right . D: Alright . D: Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . A: Mm . C: Feel good meaning what ? D: Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically . C: Physically , okay . A: Right . A: Sqi Right . D: That's just for current trend . D: It doesn't really count , you guys . B: Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . D: Yeah . D: But it's so we do have removable covers , right ? A: Right . B: Yes . D: Yeah , well then that's covered . D: And so we n k everybody have that ? A: Kay . A: I'll wait . D: Yeah , she's got it . D: It's good . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . D: It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? A: Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say ? C: True or false , easy to use . D: You guys Okay . A: Just orally . C: Yeah . A: Why not ? A: We have okay . A: Um easy to use . A: I vote six . D: Oh wait , that's false . A: Oh , two . D: Okay . B: I'd say two as well . C: Yeah , two . D: Two . A: Uh hello , we're great . D: That's what I say . D: Okay , fashionable ? A: Um one . B: At the moment , no . D: No . A: No . D: I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . A: Me too , very chic . D: I thi I would give it a one . B: Okay . A: One , I give it a one . B: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . D: Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . A: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right . D: What do you think ? C: Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . C: I'd give it like three or four . A: Well , now I'm . D: Okay . A: So , the average is about a two . D: Yeah , it's a two . C: But then I'm not fashionable , so don't use my opinion . A: Two or three . A: Two point five . D: That's okay . D: Yeah . B: Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . D: Um does it feel good ? A: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . D: I feel like I think it feels good . C: Does it feel good ? B: Uh the shape of it actually does uh . A: And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . A: It's gonna be curved . C: Yeah , it's gonna be thicker . A: Yeah . C: Depth . A: I think so too . D: I'll give it a two . A: Kay . A: Two . C: I'll give it a one . D: What do you say ? B: I'd say a two . A: Alright , average is two . D: Okay . A: Is it technologically innovative ? A: Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . D: Oh no , it's fine , you're I mean you're Project Manager . A: Go right ahead . D: Um yeah , I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ? A: Yes . A: Right ? A: We were able to do it with that kind of chip . C: Oh right , the Right . B: We could do it with the chip , yes . B: It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . D: And there's no way you can represent it on here . A: Yeah , right . D: Y Yeah , so . A: That was 'kay . A: And we discussed that being included . D: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? B: It Yeah . A: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . D: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three . A: Right . A: Okay . D: Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . D: But it is just a T_V_ remote . A: Yeah . A: I'd go for a three or four on that one , so okay , let's go for a three point five . C: Yeah I go four . B: Three and an half . A: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it um Well , we've covered that with the trendy . C: Squishy and fruity . D: Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . C: It's just trendy , basically . B: It's capable of being squishy and fruity . A: Sure . A: Capable . D: Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . A: Very capable . C: Okay . A: And it's very important . D: Yeah . A: Kay , there we go . D: Okay , next . A: So . A: Next . D: So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . D: Good job , team . B: How did you get that in there ? D: What ? B: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . D: It it does . A: It does . B: That was good . D: Thanks . A: Very good . A: Alright , let's go back to this No , that's it . A: Hmm . A: Oops . A: Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . A: I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . A: If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . A: Kay ? A: So let me bring that up . A: Here we go . A: Alright . A: Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a Number of components you plan to use . B: Yep . D: Two . A: Do I just put quantity being one battery , or Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Mm 'kay . A: But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . A: Oh , let's just go for a lithium . A: What do you say ? D: Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . B: Yeah , it's . A: I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right . D: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , yeah . A: Okay , down to the electronics um section . A: We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those . D: Yeah . B: Yep . A: It is a single-curved , so one of those . D: Uh . A: Oh . A: What's that ? A: Yeah , that's correct . D: Yeah . A: Kay , down here , case material . C: It's plastic . D: We plastic . A: Plastic . D: And special colour . C: And special colour . A: Kay . A: Down here , interface type . A: We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . C: No , we don't have the scroll . A: Isn't oh those are just regular buttons . D: But it's Yeah , but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? B: Well , that's the push-button too , right there . C: Buttons . A: This ? B: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . B: We're really having just push-button interface . A: Okay , so we can just go um . D: One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . B: But it that just covers the type of button we're having . B: Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . C: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons . B: Push-button . D: Okay . A: Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? B: But we just have push Yeah . C: But we don't have any scrolls . D: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . D: There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . A: Right . D: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? B: Okay . A: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . C: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? B: Let's call it th Okay . A: Two or would it be three ? D: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . C: Okay , fine . C: Yeah . D: I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . D: Well less than twenty nine even . A: Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay . D: They're a special colour . D: Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . A: Are they ? A: Oh , right . C: And then s yeah . D: And , they're a special material . A: Mm . A: Well , we're under cost then . A: Alright . C: We're over ? A: No , we're under . B: Grand . D: We're under . A: Twelve point five is our limit . C: Okay . C: Oh , I see . A: We've got eleven point two . B: So we can go to production . A: Alright . A: We can go to I dunno what I just did . A: Okay . A: Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . A: Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? A: Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . A: Now , question is , how do we do this ? B: Go back . D: I think we just discuss it . A: Discuss , sure . B: Previous . A: Alright . A: Who want who would like to go first ? B: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . C: We didn't have a whiteboard . A: Hmm . C: Yeah . D: Oh that's true . A: Hmm . C: And no internet . D: Yeah . D: No , yeah , that's a good point . D: Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . A: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? D: Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . A: Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like we yep . D: And we're a fashion forward technology company . A: You know it . B: right . A: Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? A: How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? C: I think we did well . B: Yeah . A: I think ya' did . A: Did you work well together in there , and 'kay . C: Yep . B: Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . D: Minus that one fight . D: Yeah . A: Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . C: Gouges . D: Yeah . A: We hadn't had any ma fallings out . D: I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? B: Irritating . A: Irritating . D: Irritating , yeah . C: Irritating . D: Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . A: Okay . B: The means , the whiteboard didn't work . C: And no internet . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: I have to knock that one down a couple notches . D: Yeah , and no internet . B: A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . C: Misses . C: I do . D: And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool . C: There's so much available . C: Like it's information Yeah . A: Yeah , digital pens . B: I really appreciated those , yeah . A: They were fine . D: Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . B: The use of the laptops for receiving everything . B: It was wireless too , so . D: Yeah . A: Right , laptops are extremely handy , wireless . D: And these things whoa . A: And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother . B: And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . D: Yeah . D: And Big Brother . D: Yeah . A: Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? D: Um we are really gonna sell this . D: Ta-da . A: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . C: Yeah . A: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . D: Mm-hmm . A: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think I mean that's not what technology . C: Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . A: Mm . C: They look like they did when I was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , 'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah . B: The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . A: Yeah . C: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Just the Mac font bothers me even . A: But I do like iPods , go figure . D: Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . A: Yeah . B: Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . A: Mm-hmm . A: Colours . A: Exactly . B: Yeah . A: I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . D: Oh yeah , everybody . A: Okay . A: Anyway , so that is definitely at work . B: Not me . D: Mine is amber . C: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . B: I didn't have a phone 'til university . D: Oh . C: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . D: Look at it . A: Yeah . D: That is a piece of work . A: Fashionable chic people will . C: You're kidding . D: Wow . C: No , no . D: Marketing Director says yeah . D: Fashionable people will buy it . C: No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . D: Oh , I will create desire . B: That's okay . B: We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . B: This will help them find the one . C: Ri They'll be sexy with it . A: Hmm . D: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . B: That's right . C: Oh right . D: Mm . D: That'll sell . A: There you go , marketing . C: Let you loose . B: And so the serpent says , use our remote . D: Yeah . A: Alright . C: Yeah , no . D: Yeah . A: Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . A: Um the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . B: Whoohoo . A: Alright , thank you team , you did a great job , it was lovely working with you . B: Margaritas for everyone . C: Good . D: You too . B: Yay . B: Thanks to the Project Leader .","summary":"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color, removable casing, buttons, logo, and ergonomic design. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote. The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project. The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected, at 11.2 Euros. The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries. The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process. The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype. They complained, though, that they felt constrained by the management's directives, that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment, and that they did not have internet access during the project. All participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire. All participants will fill out a final questionnaire.

{"meeting_id":"ES2012a","dialogue":"A: Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . A: Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . A: Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . A: Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . D: Mm . A: Um . A: What's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . A: Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so . A: Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . A: So we'll start with Andrew . D: Oh my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . A: Right Kendra . C: I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be working on the design . A: Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . C: Right . C: Yep , I'm just open to being creative . A: Yep , good . B: Uh I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah . A: Okay , very very quickly , um this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . A: Everybody says what they what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . A: The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . A: User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . A: And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . A: The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . A: Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . D: Um , badger . A: Mm and why ? D: Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel they're underdog kind of status and they're , the Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes . A: Uh-huh . A: Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . A: Kendra . C: Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . A: Uh-huh . A: Right , okay . B: Uh 's horses , no particular reason why . A: Uh-huh , fair enough yeah . A: I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh Sorry ? A: Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's um Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . A: It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . A: Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . A: Um , okay , um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . C: Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . C: Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know . A: No . A: Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? A: Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? A: Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ? B: Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . B: Mm . D: Like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . B: Mm . A: Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? D: Um . D: Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . D: So if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? D: Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . A: Uh-huh . D: So , sorry that's a bit vague . A: Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh Uh-huh . D: Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . A: Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? C: I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better . B: Mm . D: Mm . A: I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable . B: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh Yes , I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily . D: Well from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . B: Mm . D: I suppose . D: Easily , yeah yeah . C: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better . D: Mm . B: Mm . A: Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different . A: Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . A: Do we do we want uh Yeah . C: Oh yeah . B: Mm that would be good . C: Like a like a mobile phone ? B: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Mm , yeah that would be good . B: Mm . A: Okay . A: So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ? D: Mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . D: Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh is practically sound . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . A: Okay , yeah , yeah , well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . D: If you . D: Mm . A: Um okay well first thoughts on um the the industrial design side . B: Oh I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . B: They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . A: Indeed . B: Uh I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . A: Yeah . B: But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size . A: Okay , and um colours , materials ? A: Kendra , anyone ? C: Well , most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called ? C: Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things . A: Yeah . B: Mm , mm-hmm . A: Uh-huh . C: Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest . A: Right . A: Yeah . A: Okay that's uh Again I don't think that's ever been done before , it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so . B: Mm-hmm . A: Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? D: Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . B: Mm . A: Yeah . D: Unless you were trying to Mm . A: Yeah . B: Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money . A: I think Mm-mm . C: Yeah . D: Oh it's that's a that's a good idea . C: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Right , okay I think we've got um a good idea now . D: Yeah true . A: We uh meeting is uh Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . A: So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . A: Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . A: Uh thank you very much indeed . C: Okay . B: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by welcoming everybody and saying they will be developing a new television remote control.

{"meeting_id":"ES2012b","dialogue":"A: Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . A: Um I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally , so uh . C: Sorry . A: Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . A: Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . A: Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . A: Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . A: Um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . A: And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . A: Um . A: Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . A: Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . A: Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . A: Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh Anyway . A: Okay . A: Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . A: Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . A: Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . A: The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . A: Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . A: Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . A: Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . A: Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . A: But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . A: Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . A: Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . A: Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh um notes sent out and uh etcetera . A: Okay , so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . A: Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? D: Uh I don't mind . A: P fine . D: Uh can I steal the cable ? A: Oh sorry , you can indeed . D: Cheers . D: I got a how do I start there ? A: Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . D: That one . A: That one . D: Cool . D: Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . D: Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . D: Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . D: And general opinions about current current remotes . D: See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . D: So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . D: Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . D: Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . D: Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . D: I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . D: If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . D: Uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . D: I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . D: And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . D: So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . D: Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . D: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . A: Mm . D: Maybe like it'll beep or something . D: And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff . D: And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . D: Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . A: Mm . A: Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . D: But uh yeah . D: It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would . D: And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . D: I don't actually know what the results for that were , so . A: Mm . A: Right . A: Mm . D: May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . A: Yeah , I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , j just get jaw ache . D: And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you Yeah , um oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . A: Okay , sorry . D: Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . D: Um . D: You see this okay ? D: Almost no ? D: It's sorry it's a bit . D: I'll read out to you . D: Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . D: So um like the power . D: Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . D: You see what I mean ? D: Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . D: Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . D: So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . B: Mm . D: And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily Oh yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? A: I mean Yeah . C: Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . B: Mm . A: Mm . A: Hmm , hmm . B: Mm . D: Yeah , like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath . A: Uh . C: Yeah . A: Should we actually bite the bullet here ? B: Mm . A: If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . D: Just remove them completely ? C: That might be the Maybe i Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . A: We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . A: Now do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . D: Uh yeah . A: Yes we That would 've speech recogn right . D: Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition . A: So , we're looking at um well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . D: Yeah , that's true . A: If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . B: P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . B: If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . A: But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it . B: It might Mm . D: Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . D: You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to Yeah . B: Mm . C: No . B: Yeah . D: B_B_C_ one . C: Oh . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , that's true . D: Oh yeah . A: Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . A: And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . C: Yeah . A: Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . A: I mean if they weren't there , would people miss them ? D: Mm-mm . B: But look at the importance of them . B: The volume settings . D: Relevance of two out of ten , yeah . A: Vol volume , yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . B: Yeah . B: They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used . B: Yeah . A: And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . B: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Uh channel and volume are the only ones that uh would appear to be essential . D: Stand out . A: Um . A: So we if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . D: Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . A: Do , please . D: Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word . A: Mm-hmm . D: Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command . A: You cer certainly could . B: Mm . A: Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say B_B_C_ one . D: Oh I see . D: Oh yeah , I see . A: Um okay , I mean you could print actually print it on the uh device itself . D: Mm-hmm , yeah . A: Um . D: I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . A: S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . D: Mm . A: Um and I I I s so I suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . A: Anyway , sorry , carry on . A: Do you want to just carry on with or no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . D: Oh no I I interrupted you , sorry . D: Oh okay . D: Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . D: Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . A: Mm okay . D: We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . D: alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . D: But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . A: Mm-hmm . A: S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're Certainly could . D: Oh , we could , yeah . D: We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . D: So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really Yeah and probably it would look better as well . B: Mm . A: Yeah , yeah . A: The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . A: No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . D: Yeah . A: Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . D: yeah . B: Mm . D: Lined with numbered buttons and Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . A: Mm , yeah . A: Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? A: Yep , yep . A: Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh . C: Okay well , I can do mine . B: Hmm . D: Do you want the cable ? C: Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . C: Um . B: Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . C: Oh . D: F_ eight . B: F_ eight . C: Is it doing Okay . B: Dunno . D: Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . A: Ah , there we go . B: Oh yeah , it's going . C: Oh okay . C: Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . A: Alright . C: So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . C: Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . C: There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . A: Mm-hmm . C: So these are the two different ones . C: This one um this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . A: Mm-hmm . C: So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . C: And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . C: And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . C: Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . C: It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . A: Mm , yeah . C: Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . C: E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . C: So that's my presentation . C: Yeah . A: Okay , can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . A: I'm actually gonna use the Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional in fact , um I won't even go that far . C: F they probably clip to you . B: Oh yeah , they might be movable . D: Yeah . B: Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . A: Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source . B: Mm . A: Uh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available . B: Mm . A: Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . A: Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . A: Um but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . A: Um and nothing else . A: Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it . A: Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ? B: Yes , mm . C: Oh . B: Which one does this plug into ? C: Hmm I think it's all there . B: That one . C: H Oh yeah . B: I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool . C: That's kind of strange . B: Oh well . B: Anyways . B: Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . B: Oh there we go . B: Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . B: Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . B: Um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . B: Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . B: Um Oh shoot . B: Okay . B: Uh just general findings . B: Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . B: Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . B: And um oops . B: Uh-huh . B: This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . B: Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . D: Hmm . B: Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? B: Sends signals to the the television . B: And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there . B: And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . B: Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . B: Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . B: And that's pretty much it . A: Okay . A: Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . A: Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . A: Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . A: You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . A: By which time I mean when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . B: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . B: Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? B: Oh , cool . B: Yeah , fair enough . A: Um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . A: I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . A: Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it Yeah . D: It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . B: Mm , mm . A: Are are people really gonna use it though ? D: I suppose , yeah . C: Yeah , people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so . A: Um . B: Mm yeah . A: I I th I think Yeah , it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . B: Mm-mm . D: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Um . B: Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . B: And that's pretty much yeah . C: Yeah . A: When it yeah , wh when it's died is a problem . B: Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , yeah . A: Yeah , yeah , yeah , so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? B: Yeah , think that's a good idea . D: Uh . D: That sounds pretty good , yeah . C: No . A: Is the uh you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . C: Um . B: Mm . A: Um you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . C: Do they make batteries that last that long ? A: I mean th th certainly . A: Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy . A: I mean calculators for example . B: They usually have the little light uh source , I dunno what the heck they're called , the but yeah , the little cells that Yeah . C: Yeah , they have that little solar Yeah . A: Som well some do , I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . A: In in fact I'd Yeah , uh uh Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . B: Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it . C: Mm . B: Mm . A: I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . B: Mm . B: Oh , it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , yeah . A: Um . C: Yeah , some people are Yeah . A: If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n Right . B: Yeah , then they're clicking a lot , yeah . C: Yeah . D: W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour . B: Yeah . C: Per hour ? C: Wow . D: Yeah . C: That's a lot . B: Yeah . A: Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . A: That does sound excessive . D: But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like That's it's less than a second , um . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . B: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uh-oh . A: Um . A: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . A: Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . A: We're looking at extreme simplicity . A: We're looking at a radically different shape . A: Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . A: Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . A: But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions . A: Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . A: Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . A: Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yep . B: Hmm . A: Right . C: Um Oh I just have one question . A: So uh Yeah . C: So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , we okay , okay . A: We are doing just the television . A: No . A: I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ? B: Mm . C: Okay . D: Yeah , like in the email of television only . D: In fact they're in the constraints email that I got . A: Right . D: Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? A: Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . B: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Oh okay . B: Yeah . D: Oh yeah . C: Oh okay . B: Okay . A: Um That's that that that that's their uh their view . A: Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed . C: Okay . B: Cool .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by going through notes from the last meeting, recapping the topics covered. He tells them some new project requirements given by management. The marketing expert presents, talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people. They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons, one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether, or one that combines the two functions. The interface specialist presents, showing examples of two different products- one that is user-centered and another that is engineering-centered and giving personal preference to the simpler one because it is easier to use and has fewer buttons. Next the industrial designer presents, explaining how a remote control works and giving personal preference to a remote which has a large energy source such as a rechargable battery or battery dock. The group discusses using a battery that will last 5-10 years or a solar combined with a battery. They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting. Teletext no longer important given rise of internet and thus will not be used. The remote will be for television only. Device will incorporate company logo and colors. The remote will be extremely simple. The remote will be a radiaclly different shape. The remote will have few buttons, but the main ones such as channel, volume, on\/off. Whether to use voice recognition. What type of battery to use - long-lasting ordinary battery or solar + regular battery. Whether to use changable covers.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the second design group meeting, the team delved into the previous meeting's notes highlighting the need for a remote control redesign to address issues like boring shapes and colors, multiple device control, and ease of use without pointing.

{"meeting_id":"ES2012c","dialogue":"A: Alright ? A: Alright . A: Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . A: Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . A: Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . A: Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . A: Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . A: Um and people lose them . A: And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . A: That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . A: So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . A: Uh Okay . A: So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . A: Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . A: And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . A: And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . A: Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? A: Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? A: Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . A: But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . A: And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . A: Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . A: Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . A: And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . A: Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . B: Okay . A: Kate . B: Um Um p there we go . A: Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . B: Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . B: And Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . B: Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . B: Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . B: Um . B: Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . B: This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels . B: Um . B: Oh . B: Uh cool . B: Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . B: Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . B: Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . B: That's something we should think about . B: Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . B: Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . B: Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . B: Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . B: And that pretty much sums it up . A: Okay , so how um sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? B: Mm . B: Oh yep , sorry . B: Yep . A: Um . A: Uh d d d okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . B: Mm . A: Do we do we know uh by how much ? B: Um I don't actually have any price information , no . A: And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . B: Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . B: Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time . A: Right , okay . A: Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . A: Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . B: Mm . A: Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? C: I I just have a question about that . C: Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w Okay . B: W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . B: Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . C: Then it doesn't matter . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . A: So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no , I mean , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? C: Yeah . B: Uh bits of it , yeah . A: So uh Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh uh decide . C: Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . B: Yes , as well . C: As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . C: Yeah . D: Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . B: Mm . A: Yeah , that's that's right . A: It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . C: Yeah . A: But we don't know . A: Um . A: I mean uh I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . A: Um . A: Thoughts ? C: Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead . D: Would Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . A: I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? B: Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to Hm . A: I mean I think we Mm . C: Oh yeah . C: Okay . C: Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . A: Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh Yeah , yeah . B: Mm . C: And we've been talking about it the whole time . B: Mm , mm . C: Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . A: Mm , right , okay . B: Mm . D: Uh yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . C: Yeah . D: From uh my presentation show , so . A: Yeah , it should be Right , okay , so . D: Uh technologically innovative . B: No , that sounds good . A: Fine . A: Okay . B: Mm . A: I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? B: Mm . C: Okay . B: Cool . B: Um Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . C: Yeah . C: I think so . A: Right . A: Okay . A: Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? B: Uh nope , that was it , that was it . A: No ? A: Okay . A: Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? B: Okay . C: Okay . A: Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . C: Let's see . A: Mm . A: Oh good . C: Oh . C: Yes . C: Is it gonna work ? B: Yeah , it's thinking about it . A: Mm yeah , it'll get there . A: Yep . C: Okay . B: Yeah . C: Okay , so I did some research on the internet and um what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . C: Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . A: Mm-hmm . C: There're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , um different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . A: Mm , yeah . A: Uh-huh . A: Alright . C: So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . A: Mm yeah . A: Sorry y y yeah , if I can interrupt you . A: Well d p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? B: Mm . A: I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . B: Uh Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . B: I I mean , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . B: I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . A: Okay , fair enough , fine . B: Mm yeah . C: Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing . B: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Good , good . A: Yeah . A: So three three there's three buttons on a slider . A: Three buttons , channel up channel up down and Uh-huh . C: Y yes , yes . D: Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . D: Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . C: Yeah . B: Mm . D: So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . D: So you kinda take it up one at a time . A: Okay . C: The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . D: D Oh . A: Um Mm-hmm . A: This one on the one side and one yeah . D: Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a Dep I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . B: Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . A: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: You'd know what you were fiddling with . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . C: That was Yeah . B: Mm . A: Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change of one sort . C: Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , but what what do you guys think ? A: Just for the volume , uh . B: Mm . C: We could Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah , 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would Mm yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Fingers , yeah . A: I mean it's it's It yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . C: B Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Oh yeah , yeah . A: So okay . C: I'm just gonna pass this along . A: Right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine . C: Yes . C: Yeah . A: Mm right . D: Here we go . A: Right . D: Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . A: Mm-hmm . D: The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . D: And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . D: And uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel uh instead of the current functional look and feel . A: Mm-hmm . D: This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . A: Mm . D: So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh Uh exactly , yeah . A: Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . C: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Okay . D: I s that out of sequence ? D: Uh yeah , sorry . D: Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . C: Oh . D: Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . A: Uh-huh . A: Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . B: Mm . D: Yeah . D: But uh I was gonna say um yeah , fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . A: What ? A: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . D: But fashions do don't last very long . B: Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah . D: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and A kind of yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . A: Uh . C: Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . C: You know , that kind of spongy yeah . B: Mm , yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , but yeah . A: Uh . B: Mm . A: Also means you can drop it without damaging it . D: Oh Yeah . B: Uh , yeah , it's good as well . D: That's c cool . C: Yeah , that's true . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? D: Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? D: With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . C: Yeah . B: Mm . A: I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . B: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . C: Wh What if we included the batteries in the cover ? B: I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Yeah . A: Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . B: Mm . B: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Oh yeah . C: So um like Yeah , so can I see that thing ? B: I like that . B: That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah . B: Um . A: S Yeah , yeah , I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together and it it it you know , total reliability , but I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . C: Just this as examples . C: So f Yeah , I guess that's true . B: Uh yeah . B: Mm . D: Or well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . B: Mm-hmm . D: And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . D: And then Yeah , you probably are right . A: I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . B: Mm . C: Yeah , that's true . B: Mm . A: Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . C: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , I mean it is it's up to it's up to Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . C: Yeah , just another five Euro to get Right . B: So , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm , yeah . A: Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . B: Mm . C: Yeah . A: And um that's that's right , yeah , yeah . B: And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . C: Yeah , like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . B: Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , okay . A: So uh i so uh okay . A: Um right , sorry . A: Um we hadn't finished your It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . D: Um oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um this is fashionable . D: Yeah . D: This is fashionable with Oh yeah . B: Yeah . A: I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . A: And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . A: Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . B: Mm . A: And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . B: Mm . A: Um mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . B: I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , but I'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . A: Yeah uh the the uh or or b Yeah , I'd I'd um yeah . C: Yeah , like an . C: Yeah . A: Uh no I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . D: And make that a fashion symbol as well . C: Well n Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . A: Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . A: And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . A: Yeah . C: So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: I mean that was just an idea that I had . A: I mean I've uh yeah . A: Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , maybe . B: Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . C: Kind of a c Yeah . A: W it I mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . B: So maybe it'd be Yeah , yeah . C: Sort of a combination . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it . C: Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had Yeah , then wider up here . B: Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah . C: And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Yeah , cool . C: What do you guys think about that ? D: Yeah , that sounds Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . A: Okay , yeah , yeah . D: I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? C: Oh yeah . B: Yeah . A: It's a very good point . C: It is a very good point . B: Yeah . A: I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . A: That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh yeah . C: Yeah . B: But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah . A: Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , and just say Yeah , I suppose I sup So I guess we could have a menu button as well . D: Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . B: Mm . A: I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . D: Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . A: It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um . B: Bu Mm . D: Hmm yeah . B: Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . B: I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . A: Uh Yeah . D: Yeah , that's a good idea . D: Yeah . A: If we we're I mean I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . B: Yeah Yeah . C: We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . C: So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . A: Uh uh uh Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . A: Do we need some sort of display ? B: But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . C: Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . A: We actually use the television , okay . C: Yeah , and then y Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work . A: Okay , okay , okay . D: Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . A: Yep . B: Yeah , yeah , that's true . B: I never understood how that worked though , but yeah . C: Yeah , it's like um yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . B: Yeah , mm . C: You just press it . C: Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . B: Mm , oka yeah . B: Yeah . D: Uh yeah . C: You know what I mean ? A: Mm yeah . A: Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . C: Okay . B: Cool . A: So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . B: Play with play-dough . D: Hmm . A: Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . D: Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . A: Yeah , certainly , of course . D: Our energy source is gonna be long term . A: I think I think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , I you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . B: Mm . D: Cool . D: Uh And we're having a custom chip ? B: Yeah . A: We're having a a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . A: Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . D: And interchangeable case ? A: I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . B: Mm . A: Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . B: Mm . C: Yeah . A: And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . D: Mm , mm-hmm . A: We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . D: And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or Cool . A: Um the that I mean that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . C: Yeah , I think so too . B: Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and Yeah . B: Mm different to feel , yeah , yeah . A: Yeah , yeah . A: And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Yep , yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . D: Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just As wide as possible . A: As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um . B: Yeah . C: Like this or like this . B: Mm yeah . A: Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . A: Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . C: Yeah , kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , mm . A: Um so Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . B: Mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here . B: Yep , sounds good . C: Yep . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . B: Kay . C: Okay . B: Kay .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by recapping the discussions of the previous meeting, telling the group this meeting's agenda, and stating what each person will do for the next meeting.

The interface specialist present research from the internet about user interface. He talks about minimizing the clutter on the remote, and suggests using a slide button like on a mouse. The marketing expert presents, talking about trend-watching and how fruits and vegetables are currently an important theme. They talk about making changable colors available and possibly including batteries with them. They discuss what the remote should look like in terms of shape color, and then talk about components, materials, and energy sources. Then they close the meeting. The marketing expert will be doing the product evaulation. The interface designer will be looking at the look, feel, and design. The industrial specialist will be looking at how the user uses the product. The interface designer and industrial specialist will be producing a model of the product The remote will have a long-term battery source. The remote will contain a custom chip. Will be curved, shape similar to a computer mouse, but narrower. Will have voice with fewer buttons. Will have menu, channel, power, volume buttons. No display screen. If used, face plates will be cheap. To add voice option, likely need to design own chip. However, a custom design chip is more expensive and would take longer than using an existing chip. Whether to use changable face plates.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the third meeting of the design group, the team, consisting of A, Kate, Kendra, and Andrew, discussed the need for a new remote control design that addresses issues with existing ones, focusing on aesthetics and functionality.

{"meeting_id":"ES2012d","dialogue":"A: Right well . A: Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . A: Um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . A: Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . B: Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . B: Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . B: Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . A: Uh-huh . B: Uh that's the little menu key . B: This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . A: Yep , yeah , good , good . B: Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . A: Uh-huh . A: Yep , right . B: Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . A: Uh-huh . C: Mm . C: S And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . A: Yep , yep , mm-hmm . B: Um . B: Mm . A: Uh-huh . A: Yep yep . A: Yep . B: Mm . A: showing me age , I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . C: Yeah , well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . A: Yeah yeah . A: Uh-huh . B: Yeah . A: Okay , yep , right . B: Mm-hmm . B: But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . A: Okay . B: This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . A: Yep . A: Okay , good yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yep , right . B: Li that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , yeah . A: I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? C: Like that . A: Right . A: Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh Yeah , well . B: Yeah it could stand , yeah . C: Oh . B: Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . B: Yeah , standing . B: Yeah , we could just widen it out uh Mm . B: Mm . D: Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . B: Mm , yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . C: Yeah , just kind of Or just make it little . A: Yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's these uh Yeah . B: Yeah , mm . C: Somewhere like that so it just sort of Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . D: Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda Uh yeah , just click there . B: Yeah . C: Bu . A: But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . B: Mm . C: fall over . B: The final product would actually stand up , yeah . C: Yeah . A: But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: S a little longer . B: Wee Mm . C: Yeah . A: Um , so good that's that that's excellent . A: Um right let us um What's on the next one ? A: Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . A: Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I get the uh spreadsheet up . A: Oh . D: Uh the the maximise button . A: Oh right . A: Ah . A: Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . A: Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . A: Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . A: The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . A: Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . A: Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . A: Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . A: Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: Um . A: Okay , uh . A: So um . A: Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? D: Evaluation . D: The the product or the project ? A: The the the well the I meant the product . D: Um , well well my presentation just now ? A: Yeah . D: Sure , uh can I get the Cheers . A: Oh sorry yeah um , mm . A: Mm . A: More loud clicks in the microphone . D: There we go , oh . D: Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . D: So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions . D: So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . A: Seven being a nice round number to work to . D: Yeah . D: And then at the end just take an average Yes . A: Tr On for true and seven for flase . A: Yes . D: So uh . D: So , look at these questions . D: Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? A: Well I think most definitely . B: Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah . C: I think it is yeah . D: So uh and also uh technologically innovative ? A: Yes the voice technology indeed . B: Yeah , defi yeah , yeah Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Easy to use ? A: I don't see we could've made it any easier . C: Yeah . D: Uh suitable for the consumer ? D: That was um Yeah . A: Totally . B: Yeah definitely . C: Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants . B: Yeah . D: Uh is it complicated ? A: No . C: No . D: Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? D: Uh functional ? A: Yeah . B: Yeah definitely . C: Yeah . D: Um . D: Where are we ? A: found easily . D: We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . A: yeah I mean that's that's Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Uh-huh . A: Does it take long to learn to use ? A: Shouldn't . B: No , not at all . D: Mm-hmm . D: And uh , what else ? D: The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well . A: Less buttons so it must be . B: Uh Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . D: We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to Um will device appeal to all age groups ? C: Yeah . A: So yeah , um um . B: yeah . A: I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so Yeah . B: Mm . C: I think so . D: Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . B: Mm . D: Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . B: Mm . B: I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . D: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ? C: Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . D: Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? D: Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's Um . A: in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's it's simple to use , um it's it's it's within budget , um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue . B: Yep . B: Mm-hmm . C: Under the cost . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yep . A: So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh coming up with what Need a need a calculator for that . B: Yep . D: Okay . B: Well done us . D: So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . D: Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . C: Yeah , . D: And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . B: Excellent . A: Okay , nick the cable back then . C: I mixed up the colours a little bit . B: Oh no that's Uh . C: I think I all wrong . A: Ooh . A: Right do um either of you want to uh say anything ? A: Mm . C: Mm . A: Before I uh No . C: Ps I don't think so , I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . B: Mm . B: Yeah , definitely . A: Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach . B: Mm . C: Yeah . B: Yep . A: Um are the costs within budget ? A: Yes . A: Is the project evaluated ? A: We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath . B: Yep . C: Alright . C: Yeah . A: So I call the meeting closed . C: Okay . A: Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda.

A: You ready back there ? A: Uh okay . A: Welcome everyone . A: Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . A: Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . A: As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . A: Okay . A: The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . A: That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . A: The originality um is gonna take all of us . A: Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . A: Um and we'll get on with it . A: Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . A: Okay ? A: Right . A: Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . A: Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . B: Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . B: Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . B: Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? A: Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . B: Um Only animal I could thin I could draw . C: Are we all gonna draw a cat ? D: I know . A: Ah . B: Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . B: You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . A: Uh-huh . B: Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of Right , yeah . A: Okay . A: Great . A: And the characteristics ? B: Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . A: Uh-huh . B: In fact , I'll give it some more Oh , and the tail Yes . A: Okay . A: Fantastic . A: Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . A: I think it's to get us used to using the pen . B: Um sure it's not to test our artistic It's a mouse . A: Uh no . A: A mouse-y ? C: That's not a mouse-y , no . B: No it's not a mouse . B: It's a wombat . A: Oh . C: It's a ratty . A: Argh . B: A what ? C: A ratty . A: Rat . A: Not a mouse , a rat . B: A webbed foot . B: Webbed f Oh right . C: It's clothes . C: That's it's clothes . C: It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . A: And your favourite characteristics of that animal . C: I love whiskers . C: Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly . A: Oh . A: Okay . C: And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . A: Kate ? D: Thanks . A: Oh , a fish . C: A shark ? B: Gosh , why didn't I think of fish ? B: That's even easier to draw than cat . D: Mm this is very representational fish . A: Oh , okay . A: Fine . D: Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . A: Favourite characteristics ? A: Kay . A: So they have team elements . D: Do you have a favourite one ? A: I'm afraid I'm with Steph . A: And I think your pen's running out of whatever . A: But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . A: He's hiding . A: Um cats are sometimes very independent . A: My parents had cats . A: Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . A: Okay . A: Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . A: That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . A: Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . A: Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . A: Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . A: Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? D: Uh yeah . D: I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal B yeah . A: Mark-up ? D: Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . D: But um let me I have two thoughts . A: Okay . D: One hundred , fifty percent . D: And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? A: Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . D: At twenty five . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , that's um So that's four million of them ? A: To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . A: Something like that ? A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: That's fifty million Euros . A: In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each That's a lot of selling . D: And if we make Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: Two four To be fifty , be four million . D: Four million . A: You'd have to sell four million . D: Hmm . A: Okay ? A: Right . A: Experience with a remote control . A: Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? B: That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and I think one that works would be good . A: You're both nodding , all three . D: Yeah . A: Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . C: It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . D: Mm-hmm . D: Y yeah . A: And they don't always talk to each other . C: But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . A: Don't know . A: Okay . A: Are there any um ideas for the remote ? A: What would it be for and what group would be be for ? A: We have to think about that one . D: We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote . C: I think one in b bright colours would be good . D: Yeah . D: We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . D: Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . D: Electrical their industrial design is very good . C: I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . C: Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like . D: Yeah . D: Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . A: Okay . D: We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . C: Mm . A: Mm . D: Mm . A: Okay . D: We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . C: Ooh , closing the meeting . A: Yeah . A: Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . C: That was quick . B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . A: I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . A: Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . A: Do you all agree ? C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Alright . A: Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . A: Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . D: Okay . B: Kay . A: Thank you all .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members.

{"meeting_id":"ES2013b","dialogue":"A: Uh it fell off . A: One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready . A: Okay . A: Welcome to this second meeting . A: Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . A: This is a meeting on functional design . A: Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . A: Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . A: Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . A: Okay ? A: Is this ap everybody agree with this ? C: Yes . B: Oops . D: Yes . A: Okay . A: Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . A: Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . A: And go to that one . A: Um as you can see it was this earlier today . A: Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . A: I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . A: Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . A: And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? A: Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? A: Kay . B: Uh I think so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . A: Did I miss something ? D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . B: Okay . A: So um as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes . D: Okay , I accept the minutes . A: And uh okay . D: Is that what we're supposed to say ? A: Yeah . C: Yeah , I do . A: Good . A: Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . A: Okay ? D: Okay . A: Okay . A: Mm we need to move this . A: Who wants to go f first ? A: That's as far as it goes . C: Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . C: Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? C: That's fine . D: Excellent , thank you . B: Oy , big loop under the table . A: She said we didn't need to screw it in . D: Okay . D: Okay , that looks good . A: It's doing its thing . A: There we are . D: Alright . D: Thank you very much . D: Um . D: One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . D: So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . D: Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . D: And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . D: And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . D: So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . D: Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . D: And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . B: Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've Mm-hmm . D: Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . A: Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . A: Mm . D: So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . D: So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . A: Hmm . A: Okay . D: Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . D: Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . A: Mm . A: Is that a large enough target market to target it ? D: I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh Yeah . A: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? D: To Um yes . A: Or eight million . D: Yes . D: But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . A: Hmm . A: Yeah . D: I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . B: Um How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . A: Mm . C: Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . A: Mm . D: Shall I go back ? D: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? D: Exactly . D: I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . D: You know , it's I a and I think , you know No , no , you Kate , you're exactly right there . B: Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . B: He must be w one of a s small population . A: Mm . D: But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be Uh , mm . A: But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups . D: Exactly . D: I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . A: Leap . A: Hmm . D: Or comfortable , you know , um so I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . A: Mm . A: Okay , you had the other power channel . D: And this is this is also supported by the market research . A: Okay . D: Thank you . D: That's my contribution . A: Alright . A: And we'll turn to the next presentation . A: I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . A: And then press , what ? A: F F_N_ and F_ eight . A: Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top . C: Yeah , press them . A: And then w be patient . C: Yeah , here we go . A: Tada . B: And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . C: Can I not just uh do each one in order ? B: I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one , that one there . A: There we are . C: That ? A: Yay . C: That ? B: Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . C: That ? B: And then you just press the click when you wanna go on . C: Right , technical functions design . C: Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . C: I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . C: So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . C: And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . C: If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . A: Okay . C: Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . A: T_V_ only . C: So these are two models of existing remote controls . C: Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . A: Ugh . C: It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . C: It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . A: Hmm . C: Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . C: I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . C: Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . A: Mm . A: And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . C: So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . A: Okay . A: Alright . C: Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . A: Okay . A: Any uh thing else you wanna add ? C: No . A: Okay . C: But we could go back to the pictures of the uh , what're they called ? C: The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . D: Or if Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Let's hear what Kate has to say . C: Okay then . D: Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . A: Hmm . D: Whiteboard session . A: I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , It's there but it's Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's Sorry I was just I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . C: The the style of these is terrible . C: I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . D: The ergonomics , the way it fits in your Yeah . A: Hmm . C: But So that's that for now . B: Cheers . B: Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . A: Okay . B: Still , I'll do without that . B: Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . B: Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . B: Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . B: But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . B: So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . B: It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . B: And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . B: Now I would have hoped I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . B: I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . B: So we want an energy source which is there . B: And we've got to think about what that might be . B: Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . A: Hmm-mm . B: Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . B: Um and then we have the the user interface . B: Oops . B: And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . B: So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . B: Thank you . A: Hmm . A: Okay . A: Right . A: But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? A: What do the buttons look like ? A: Uh what does it feel like ? A: That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . B: Mm-hmm . A: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . A: For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? A: Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . A: Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? B: Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . B: We're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . A: Mm . B: Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . A: Okay . B: I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . D: Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? C: Whoop . A: Okay . D: Because then No , the chip composer marketing . C: Isn't that your job ? A: Oh . C: Oh right . D: Oh no , the chip composer sender . A: Mm . B: Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but Yeah . D: I I don't believe I know , um . A: What they cost . D: Okay . A: Okay . D: Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired , but basically just the same . D: Mm-hmm . D: Inspired ? D: Mm . C: Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . C: Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? D: Mm-hmm . C: With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . D: Mm-hmm . C: You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , which are You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah . D: Well that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . A: Mm . D: Yeah , but it also has a place , so exactly . C: And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . A: Mm . C: But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . D: That's a really good idea . B: Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . B: I'll do some research for the next meeting . D: Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . A: Okay . A: Uh yeah . B: Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , but Yeah , I guess . D: Yeah , yeah . A: Mm . C: Well it is just so annoying how No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and you know f Mm . D: Depen Mm . A: It would have to sor store up the energy and then use it . D: Yeah . A: Solar can do that . B: We may be talking quite heavy then . D: Yeah . A: M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . B: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm Mm-hmm . B: So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? D: Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , exactly . A: Mm . A: Mm . C: Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . A: Yeah . D: So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is Exactly . A: And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . C: Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . D: Mm . A: Hmm . D: Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Okay . A: Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? A: Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . D: Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? B: Mm . D: You know , these are the Yeah , exactly . B: Yeah , I was wondering that , because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? A: Mm . A: I I s usually put more money than brains . D: Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . D: Good , good comment . B: Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , I don't know . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: It might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? B: Mm . B: I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? B: I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . D: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? A: We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . B: Right , good point . B: Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: That's probably more what it is . B: Yeah , good point . A: What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? D: Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Right . C: We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ? A: Probably not . D: Mm . A: Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . A: Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . A: Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . A: It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . C: Yeah . D: Do we need um let me Br actually , um the enter key I have a chart here that I didn't include . A: Is that agreeable to everyone ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um yeah , which might Th yeah , th those are felt like had a lot of charts . B: Do you want the gizmo ? A: Throw some light on that . A: Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . D: Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . A: Ah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . D: Um Exactly . A: Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . D: Again , you know , thinking of menus or Um well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . A: Is that okay with you ? C: Sorry , I was miles away . A: Would that uh-huh . B: H how does that work ? C: I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . B: How so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? A: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . B: Okay , yep , mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: It's not getting a bit complicated ? B: Could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ? D: Well Or y yeah . D: Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . C: Who's got an iPod then ? D: Yeah , I don't um I wish . A: Mm . D: Anyway , uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . A: Okay . D: It's definitely channel , volume , power . A: Mm . C: Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . D: Exactly . D: Exactly . C: I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . D: Yeah . D: Okay , well . A: Okay . D: Thanks for looking at that . A: So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . D: Mm-hmm . D: We don't wanna outsmart Hmm . A: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . A: I just joined that set last week . A: Um first grandchild arrived . D: Congratulations . B: Mm . B: Uh . A: Um so are we agreed then of those things ? A: And let's go back to agenda and hook me up . D: D Oh you're fine . A: Mm . A: This oughta be fun . A: It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess . A: Come on . A: Uh it lost it off here . A: Uh No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here . D: It's fine . A: Mm . A: This time it should be both . A: There we go . B: How do you do that ? B: How do you make it do both ? A: Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , thank you a lot for telling me . B: Ah okay , it toggles through , yeah . D: I think you have to cycle through . A: Um right , we're ready to close . B: Yeah . A: Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . A: Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . A: Um and each of us will get help from our coach . A: Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? C: Yes . A: Okay . B: Sounds good . A: Then that's the end of this meeting . A: And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . A: Okay ? B: Okay . C: We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . A: Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them . C: Alright , well that's fine then . A: Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . D: Okay . D: Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself Yeah , I think I've Okay . A: Okay . A: Um the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . B: So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? C: Mm . C: Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? A: It doesn't tell me . D: Mm . C: From their I'll just use it from their website . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay ? C: Okay . B: Okay . D: Right . D: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting.

{"meeting_id":"ES2013c","dialogue":"A: Hi Kate . B: Just just carry on . A: Okay , carry on . A: Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . A: Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . A: Um and we should each have a presentation to make . A: Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . A: It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . A: Okay . A: Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . A: Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . A: Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . A: And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . A: I think all of us agreed with those things . A: Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . A: Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . A: Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . A: Um the corporate image . A: So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . A: Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . A: Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . A: Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . A: Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . A: Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . A: And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . A: Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? C: Yeah . C: Yes . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Right . A: So we're ready to close that and go back to our That one . A: Right . A: We're up to the point of the Go back . A: Um the three presentations . A: So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . A: Is that okay ? A: Is that alright with everybody else ? C: Yep . B: Mm-hmm . A: Especially since Kate asked to be last . A: Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ . D: I respond to either . D: No worries . A: You respond to whatever you get , huh ? A: Okay . A: Um , did you do your Hit Ah , there it is . C: Yeah , Right . A: Ta-da . D: Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . D: Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . D: But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . A: Mm 'kay . D: But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things . D: So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . D: And I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . A: Kay . B: Sorry . B: I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . D: What's hot , fruit and veg . D: Spongy . D: And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . D: This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . A: Mm . D: And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . D: So . D: I also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . D: Fancy . D: Functional is out . D: And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . D: This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . D: This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . D: Ease of use . D: Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . D: So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . B: I think that's a good idea . B: Don't you ? D: Y yeah , you know Exactly . C: Yes . A: It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . D: Exactly . D: I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . D: you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . A: Mm . D: They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . D: Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . D: They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . D: So what we're talking about is changing . D: this concept . D: Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . D: That's what's hot on the catwalks . D: So , this is my This is what I'm thinking . A: Hmm . A: Uh-huh mm . A: In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote . D: Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . A: Mm . C: So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . D: Yeah . D: W and plus I think Uh yeah . A: Mm . A: Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: So this is an idea and I I you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . D: So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . D: This spongy fruit and veg . B: Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . D: Thanks . D: Alright . C: Yep . B: Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . A: Hmm . A: Hmm . C: And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . D: I I just have my ear to the market , guys . C: Is this to the market ? B: Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . B: I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah . D: Is spongiest , yeah . D: That would add Mm-hmm . B: I was thinking titanium myself . C: I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny . D: They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . D: I think many of us would associate those with fancy . D: Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . D: We could call it uh The name . A: Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? D: Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . A: Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . D: So That , you know , that might be And then we could keep it titanium . C: Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ? C: Yeah . C: Let's delegate . A: Wo would that be agreeable ? B: Yeah . B: W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . C: Yeah , maybe . C: Or I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . A: Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? A: Okay , we'll move the Mm . C: Um You can even have them in different flavours as well . C: So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Or s or smelly . D: Scratchy Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . C: Scratch and sniff . D: It's hot on the streets , guys . B: Right , well I I I think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . B: So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . B: Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . B: I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? B: No . B: Um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? B: Right . B: This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface . A: Mm . B: And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . B: Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . B: We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . B: So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . B: So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . B: Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . B: We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . C: A wind-up . B: Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . A: Alright . A: Remember , we only have forty minutes Hmm . D: Mm . B: You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . D: Hmm . B: Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . A: Mm . B: Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . B: It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . D: Hmm . B: Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . D: Hmm . D: Hmm . B: Okay , what does the interface look like ? B: Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . B: Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . A: Hmm . B: Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . B: And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . B: Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . B: If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . B: All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . B: Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . B: If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . B: And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . B: Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . B: Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . D: Mm . B: And well I I think we've got two options . B: We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . B: Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that may or may not be a good thing . B: Sorry . B: Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . B: So , thank you . D: That sounds good . D: Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . D: Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? B: Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . B: Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . A: Hmm . D: Hmm . D: Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . D: But I think the important thing might be to choose one . D: You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry . B: Yeah mm-hmm . D: That's uh Alright , well let's see then . C: Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . B: Banana ? C: But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . D: Yeah . C: It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . D: Yeah . C: That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . D: But yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . B: We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier . D: Yeah . D: Hmm . C: Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . D: Yeah . D: Mm . B: Yep . D: Thank you , Kate . A: Thank you , Kate . D: Mm . C: You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . C: So so mine's a bit pointless . C: Right . C: F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? A: Yes . A: There we go . C: I don't have it on mine though . D: Oh I think um Florence resolved it by F_ eight again . B: I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's it'll I think it yeah , you you will do an Hmm . A: Do it again . A: Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . C: Should I do it again ? D: Maybe . A: Yeah . A: This time it should come up both . C: Right then . C: I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . A: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . C: Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which Well , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . C: It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . A: Hmm . C: So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . C: Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . C: Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . C: Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . D: Mm . C: So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . B: Hmm . C: And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . A: Mm . B: Yeah . C: And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . B: Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . C: And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . C: I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . C: If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . B: It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . C: Yeah . C: Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . D: Hmm . C: Uh then And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . B: And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well . D: It's a duplication . C: Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . B: There is that . D: Mm-hmm . C: I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . C: Um . C: But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . C: And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . D: Mm-hmm . C: Up , down , left , right . B: Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? C: I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d uh describe it . C: you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . C: Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . B: Mm-hmm . B: Right . C: And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . C: I'm getting a bit uh specific here . C: Really we'd have to use something to show you , but If I don't think I can get it up on the screen . B: Yeah . B: I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . D: To uh m make it . C: Ah here we go . C: Right . D: Oh nice . D: Um Hmm . C: Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . A: Huh . C: It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . B: Yeah . D: Mm . C: What else have we got ? D: Wow . C: Them , they're terrible . C: But they all have this this feature of this uh It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , which I think is a really good idea . A: It's a selection wheel . B: But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . C: Yeah , like up , down , left and right . C: Which is good . C: And then and then Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . A: Okay . C: So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . A: Okay . C: And that's it . B: In fact Oh that's really nice . C: Look at look at this one . C: Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . D: Do you think with um It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . C: Might take up your whole living room . D: Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? D: And have it abstract . D: You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . C: Possibly . C: Yeah . B: Hmm . B: Mm . C: That also is possible . B: We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy Hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: I'm just just throwing out ideas . C: Just Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? A: Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . D: Yeah . D: I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Yeah . C: This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Hmm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Hmm . D: Nice . D: Good point . C: But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . C: If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . A: Mm 'kay . C: But then , that's complicated . A: I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . A: We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . A: Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . A: Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . A: So let's Mm . A: Right . A: They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . A: Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . A: The You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . A: Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . A: That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . B: Mm . A: Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? B: Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . A: Okay . B: I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost . A: Mm 'kay . A: What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? D: I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice um that it's there . C: It sounds great . C: I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . C: Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . D: It's Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . D: It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . A: Hmm . C: Yeah . C: Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? C: It's like yeah , a good selling point . A: So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . D: Be Yeah . C: But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . A: It costs . A: Mm . B: And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . A: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . D: But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . A: Mm . C: Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . B: Yeah . A: Hmm . B: True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly . C: Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: You know , kind of the That's exactly what I was thinking . A: Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . A: Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . B: Oh right , okay , I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered . B: Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative . A: Oh . A: Okay . B: I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . A: What about the ca yeah . A: Oh , the way we uh-huh . A: Oh , okay . A: Um what about the case ? A: I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . A: One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . A: Um we've sort of eliminated wood . A: We said plastic or rubber . A: What's the pleasure ? B: Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah . D: I'm sold . A: What about you ? C: Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . D: Mm . D: Kind of like an internal egg . A: Cover . A: Uh-huh . A: Plastic inside . D: Yeah . C: Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah . B: Yeah . B: I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . C: Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and Just copy the one on the left . A: Hmm . D: And with sports on television . A: Okay . D: You know . A: Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . D: I su Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . B: I should I should r Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . A: I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . A: Okay , and it says interface . A: What type and what supplements ? C: No um a scroll Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . C: Yeah , I'd like push buttons with So push buttons No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . A: Okay , um that's that . A: Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . A: Whew . A: And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . A: Marketing they want product evaluation . D: No we can't , actually . A: Oh . A: Oh my , I'm sorry . D: That's why I was looking over your shoulder Mm . A: Oh , okay . A: Sorry about that . A: missed that one . A: This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . A: Ah , ta-da . C: Now it's gone again . A: Ah . B: You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . A: Yes , because I can't even see mine . A: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . C: Oh yes . A: Yeah , right . A: Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . A: Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . C: Great . A: Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . D: Sounds good . A: Anything else we need to do ? C: I don't think so . A: Go to it . C: Play-Doh . A: And that's the end of this meeting . A: That's for her benefit . D: That's really all I got , guys .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented findings from trend watching reports and discussed her personal preferences in how to incorporate the results of the trend watching reports into the appearance of the remote. The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme, sponginess, fanciness, and technological innovation. The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design. The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources, materials, case shapes, and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens. The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel. The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources, chips, case materials, and buttons to use. The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation. The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design. The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. Two of the team members will create a prototype using modeling clay The remote will use a kinetic battery. The case of the remote will be made of rubber. The remote will contain a hard plastic inner shell to protect the interior. The remote will use push buttons. Whether to use titanium or a spongy material. Whether creating a fancy remote would adhere to the project budget. Whether to use a kinetic battery.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the conceptual design meeting, the team gathered to review the progress from the previous meetings. With Kate leading the discussion, Sarah presented findings on the current cost of competition devices, ranging from \u20ac20 to \u20ac60, while proposing a unique spongy fruit and veg-themed remote control design. Steph delved into the latest trends, emphasizing the importance of a polished and innovative look over mere functionality. Kate then detailed the technical aspects, highlighting options for energy sources like kinetic power and discussing the feasibility of chip on print manufacturing. The team leaned towards kinetic energy for its convenience and potential cost savings. They also debated the material for the case, considering a rubber exterior for a tactile experience. Decision-making extended to the user interface, where a simple push-button design with a screen display on the TV was favored. Action items were assigned: Kate for look and feel design, Steph for user interface, and Sarah for product evaluation, with a prototype to be created using modeling clay. The meeting concluded with a plan for the next steps, including individual tasks and a tight timeline, as the next meeting loomed in thirty minutes. The team left energized and ready to bring their innovative remote control concept to life.","relevance":0.3777068257,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was Sarah's proposal for the remote control design?","answer":"Sarah proposed a unique spongy fruit and veg-themed remote control design."},{"question":"What energy source option did the team lean towards and why?","answer":"The team leaned towards kinetic energy for its convenience and potential cost savings."},{"question":"What material was considered for the case of the remote control?","answer":"A rubber exterior was considered for a tactile experience."},{"question":"Who was assigned the task of look and feel design for the remote control?","answer":"Kate was assigned the task of look and feel design for the remote control."}]}

A: Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? A: Ah , we came up together , we're good . A: Okay . A: Are we ready to start ? A: Okay . A: It's now quarter of four . A: This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . A: Okay . A: Right . A: Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . A: We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . A: And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . A: So we're going to make a very fast track . A: Okay . A: Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . A: So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it ? D: Red . A: I need to open mine . A: Not the agenda . D: Agenda three . A: No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . D: Mm . A: That should be there , minutes . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? A: Cause this way I can more easily flip it . A: Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . A: Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . A: The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . A: Um we decided chip on print would be used . A: Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . A: There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . A: Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . A: Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . A: Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . A: Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . A: Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . A: Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . A: And uh we closed as it ran out of time . A: Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? C: Yes . B: Yep . A: Okay , back to this meeting . A: Um we're down to the prototype presentation . B: Ta-da . C: Alright . A: Over to you . B: Right . C: Well . A: Ooh , two . C: Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . A: Ah . C: This is the one that I made . A: Uh-huh . C: It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . C: This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . C: Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . C: I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . C: Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . C: Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . C: And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . A: Kay . A: Okay . C: Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . A: Okay . C: Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . C: The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . C: Right ? C: Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . C: Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . C: So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? C: I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . C: Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . C: So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . C: And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . C: Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . C: Can I scroll down on there and see what else Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . B: Mm-hmm . C: So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . B: Um well I don't have very much to add . B: Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . B: The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . B: We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . B: We have the technology to do that . B: Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . B: We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . B: Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . B: Um so that's for material . B: Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . B: Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . B: Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . C: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . C: This one has n banana , yeah . B: A banana . C: This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . C: Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and Hold them , you see , you know . B: Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? C: Curvature , is it to your liking ? A: Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . B: Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . C: If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . A: And then you can use your thumb . B: And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place . C: Yeah . A: I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know yeah . C: Breaking , oh right . C: Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . D: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . A: Hmm . D: It's really kind of a Mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . C: Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . C: And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . D: Yeah . D: But it's also like texting , you don't Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? B: Hmm . B: And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . C: It's texting . D: It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . C: Hmm . D: You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable . C: Yeah . C: I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: The next item is evaluation . D: No , okay . A: Uh if that's if you're finished . D: Um shall I take your uh power ? C: Uh yeah , we're finished . B: Mm-hmm . A: Oh sorry . D: Oh . A: Try again . D: Okay . D: This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . D: So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . D: So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . D: Okay . D: So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . D: And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . C: Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? D: Mm , yeah , price . C: Price of materials . A: Hmm . D: We'll put price up at the top . C: Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . A: Well we will soon , unfortunately . D: Um Okay , so Did you say ? A: Come on . A: No , . D: Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? C: It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which I'd call these quite uh minimalist , simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . D: Mm-hmm . D: I yeah , so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect . C: I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . D: Yeah . B: Well we have got s trendy further down , but Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . A: Elegant . A: Elegant . D: Elegant . D: Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um Yeah . C: like stylish or aesthetic . B: Stylish , yeah . D: Elegant . D: We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is Yeah . C: Fancy . D: N that um yeah uh the uh is fancy . C: Did you just break the pen ? D: So let's let's take it to the next level . C: Well d we'll just call it fancy then . D: Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . D: we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? D: Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both Yeah . C: Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . A: Mm . D: Yeah . C: So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so . D: Yeah . D: As a banana . D: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . A: Yeah . D: And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk . A: The chunk . C: So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . D: No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . C: Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . D: Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? A: I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . B: Yeah , I'd I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . A: It's more true than false , about a two . D: Okay . D: So we say true . D: Um technologically innovative . D: Yeah . B: I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . D: So we'll say we'll say uh false . D: Easy to use . B: Very . C: Yes . D: One , is that inappropriate ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Oh , pardon me . D: Um trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity . A: Trendy . C: Oh yes . A: Mm-hmm . C: Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , but No . B: We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . A: Hmm . B: I think yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay , so two ? B: Yeah . D: Um are there excess buttons ? A: Excess buttons . B: No . A: No . B: So that's false . D: That is false . D: Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . A: Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . D: True . D: Ugly . C: No . B: No . A: No . D: People don't respond well to ugly . D: Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . B: Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ? C: Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . A: I like it . D: Yeah , I do too . C: It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . D: Oh yeah . D: And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? D: With the Yeah , with the energy . C: Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . C: Is it the kinetic energy ? C: If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: It is going to be kinetic ? B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . D: Uh so yes . C: Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah . D: Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . C: Yeah . D: Anything else ? D: Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? B: Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . B: We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . D: Okay . A: Yes , the instinct says true . D: So true one or should I go to two or three ? B: I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true . D: Okay . C: I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . C: I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . A: Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . B: True . A: Hmm . B: Yeah , that's a good point . C: uh we need somebody to develop that . D: Um other ? D: Anything else you guys can thing of ? D: And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . C: Yeah . B: Right . D: And then um excess buttons . C: Just putting no excess buttons . D: Exactly . D: Wow we're doing really well . D: Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . C: As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . D: Mm-hmm . C: I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . D: Or L_C_D_ . D: Yeah . D: Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . D: If not I'll average those . A: I think we're good . D: Okay . D: Mm . A: Okay . D: So Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here . A: We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . A: Okay . A: Yep . A: Right . D: Thank you for everyone's help with that . A: Right . A: And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . A: And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . A: Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . A: Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . A: Okay . C: Well , just kinetic then , . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Um what's a hand dynamo ? B: That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . C: It's the wind-up . A: Oh shoot , forget that . A: Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one . B: Just one . A: Okay . A: Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . B: Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that . B: Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . A: Okay , and we only need one of those . B: Yep . A: Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . A: It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . A: It's that's uh uh one . B: Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? B: Um do we have I I think you it means you reverse the curve . C: What does double curved mean , I don't understand . A: And that's uh that's the the one that goes like this . C: Oh no , we don't need that . B: Yeah . C: No . B: Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah . A: Right . C: Single-curved , I'd say . A: No , single curve . A: Okay , case material supplements . A: Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . C: I I just wanna say plastic . A: We had the special colour . A: And did we say plastic ? B: Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess . D: One , two , three , four , five , six . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . A: Interface button push button interface . C: It's just button . C: Yeah . A: That's what we're using , isn't it ? B: Yes . B: Yep . C: Yeah . B: Do we need to say how many buttons , or or d is it just one ? A: Whoops , don't want that , not yet . A: Um No , it just says push button interface . A: Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . B: Kay . A: And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? B: Uh they'll be rubber , yep . A: So we need one of them . A: And are they any special form ? C: Well yeah , like the compass point one . B: Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? B: Cause I think they can be plastic . A: Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . B: Yeah . B: They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case . A: Oh . C: Yeah , they could be plastic . A: Okay . A: Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . B: It's just one , isn't it ? A: Uh we only need one of them . A: Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . B: What , we're in . D: Yeah . A: We're in . A: That's us . B: More profit . C: Great . A: Okay , I'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents . A: Okay . A: As our project document bit . B: Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? A: Yeah . A: There we are . A: That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . A: Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? A: Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . C: Yes . A: Right . A: Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . A: Yeah , leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . D: Sure . C: Yeah . D: Yes . C: And Play-Doh . A: Uh-huh . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . C: Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . C: So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . B: Yep . A: Okay . A: So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . D: Yep . A: Um did we find any new ideas ? D: I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes . C: Yeah . C: Spongy . D: I I only speak for myself though . C: And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . B: Yeah . C: Good work as a design team , because we Oh yes . B: Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . B: I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . A: So we actually worked well as a group . B: I thought so . A: Right . A: Are the costs within the budget ? A: Yes . D: Yes . B: Yes . A: Is the project evaluated ? C: Yes . A: Yes . B: Yes . D: I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . B: Oh hang on , we haven't heard . A: Uh-huh . D: There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . D: I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . C: Yeah . C: And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so . D: To maintain old technology , exactly . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . D: Yes . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: So we do count as I think excellent or one . A: Alright . A: And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done . D: Okay . A: We done good , and we're finished in time . C: Bring on the ice sculptures . D: Nice . B: And then we get the product launch party . D: So we might have to wait . C: Yeah . B: Product launch party ? D: Yeah . C: That's what I said , ice sculptures . B: Absolutely . D: Um I one thing I want to do is oh , I think the meeting's done . C: Is that the end of the meeting ? A: I believe that is the end of our meeting . D: Yeah . A: Thank you , Melissa . D: Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . D: The right files .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness, technological innovation, ease of use, trendiness, and marketability. Overall, the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process, in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them, the ideas they came up with, and their teamwork. The team will work on a final questionnaire. The team will work on a meeting summary. The project manager will work on a final report The remote will use a kinetic battery. The remote will use an electronic simple chip on print. The remote will use push buttons. The remote case will be single-curved. The remote will be in a special color. The remote will be made of plastic. The buttons on the remote will be black. The buttons on the remote will be made of plastic. Whether to select a banana shaped remote or a chunky remote. Whether to create a single-curved or double-curved remote. Whether to have rubber or plastic buttons.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to finalize their innovative remote control project.

{"meeting_id":"ES2015a","dialogue":"A: Alright , that did nothing . A: Okay . A: Welcome to the meeting everyone . A: Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . A: Sorry guys . D: You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . A: I did . D: Oh , okay . A: Twice . A: This'll just take a moment . B: Okay okay Okay . A: Or it won't . A: Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . A: Alright . A: Um . A: This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . A: I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . B: Hello . A: Okay . A: So um . A: So that was the opening . A: The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . A: If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . B: Okay . B: My name's Poppy . B: I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . B: Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . B: Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . A: Nice to meet you Poppy . B: Okay . C: My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . C: I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . A: Alright . D: Hi , I'm Genevieve . D: I'm the Marketing Expert . D: I'm an expert at marketing . D: Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . D: Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . A: Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . A: But um um Yeah . A: And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . A: Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . A: And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . B: Okay . B: So this is a television remote control ? A: Yes , it's a television remote control . B: Yeah . A: Right . A: I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . A: So , alright . B: Okay . A: Um , yeah . A: Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . A: Same with conceptual design and detailed design . A: So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . A: Um , tool training . A: Is , is everyone , um Okay . B: Yeah . B: Got those notes . D: Yeah . D: Thank you . A: Great . A: Great . A: Um One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . A: Um , one of them is our whiteboard . A: And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . A: Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . A: So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . B: Okay . A: Kay . A: With our microphones still attached to our bodies . B: Okay . C: Gosh . A: Okay . A: Kay , what's my favourite animal ? A: Do come up . B: Oh , to go first . B: Oh , are we all doing it individually ? A: This is a team-building time where , um , , okay cool , um My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , right now it is an elk . B: Okay , let's stand up and support you Okay . C: Yeah . C: An elk ? A: alright , so And it goes like Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah . C: A vicious We have sheep . A: Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . B: Do you have elk where you come from ? A: Yes . B: You do . A: Yeah we have moose and we have deer . D: We have moose too . B: Okay . A: Do you have 'Kay , um . B: Sheep . B: Yeah , cows . B: That's a great elk . D: Uh-oh , we have a good artist . C: That is really good . B: Yeah . C: I'm quite Very good . A: Thanks . A: This is my Okay . D: Oh , very shapely . B: Brilliant . A: That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . B: Mm . B: Very nice . A: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Right . A: Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . B: Okay , I'll go next . B: I am a big animal lover . B: I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . D: Oh . A: Oh . B: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . B: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . B: Bit more cartoon style . B: But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . B: Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . B: Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . B: They know what they want . B: Basically , that's why I like cats . A: Great . B: I'll rub that out . B: There you go . C: Okay . C: I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . B: Ooh . C: I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . C: I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . C: Um , right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . A: I forget her name . D: Tara or Tara . B: Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . C: It's a cartoon dog I think . C: A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . C: It's a scary cartoon dog . C: That This , that does not look like a dog . A: It looks kinda like a person . C: I'm sorry . B: We can pretend . D: That's Pinocchio . C: How do you draw a dog ? C: I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . C: Right . C: Yous know what it's supposed to be . C: It's a dog . B: Okay . C: Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . C: And , like they're more of a companion than cats . C: I've nothing against cats . B: Yeah , that's true . C: Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . C: But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that don't look like that . D: Alrighty . D: I feel like a robot . D: Okay . D: Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . D: I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . D: And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . D: It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . D: At first I thought it was a dead leaf . D: And then it landed on the wall next to me . D: But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . D: And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . A: It's kinda like a peacock . D: Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . D: So I thought that was pretty cool . D: And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . D: I wish I'd had my camera . D: So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . D: Yeah . D: There you go . B: Very nice . A: Great . D: Uh , what do we Oh . A: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? D: Yes I do . A: Yea Right . A: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . B: Okay . A: And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . A: Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . A: I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . A: Um , and make it for an international market . A: Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . A: Things like that , depending on which country you are . A: Another thing for the design team to think about . A: Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . D: Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? D: Twelve fifty . A: I'm bad at math . D: Okay . A: Kay . A: Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um it is discussion time . A: So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . A: Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? D: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . A: Mm-hmm . A: So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? B: Okay . D: Um Mm-hmm . B: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . B: It's always , where is the remote control ? C: Yeah . B: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . B: I dunno , some kind of alarm . B: You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost . A: Yeah . A: It's a great idea . A: It's a great idea . C: Do yous not find that , um , like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , that you don't use half of them . C: Yeah , I don't know what they do . D: Mm-hmm . D: There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . D: That's useful . D: So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . A: Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point . D: Could be shaped like a conch , you know . B: Mm . D: Be like a shell-shaped remote . A: Can hold it . B: A novelty . B: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . A: Yeah . B: Like , I've seen phones like a Okay . A: Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . A: I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . B: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . B: Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: So , hmm . A: Yeah . A: And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . B: Yeah . A: Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . B: Yeah . A: Right . A: Okay we have five minutes left . A: So , just to cover We have one more thing . A: Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . B: Yeah . A: Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . A: So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . A: Or not present but bring to the meeting . A: Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . D: Interface ? B: Industrial Designer . A: Industrial Designer . D: Oh , industrial . B: That's me . A: I have to remember these things . A: Um . A: You'll be beginning your , your working design . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . A: Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . D: Marketing Expert . A: Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . A: And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? B: Okay . A: Kay . B: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group.

{"meeting_id":"ES2015b","dialogue":"B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: That's okay . B: That's okay . B: Okay . A: Am I starting now ? A: Anytime ? A: Oh sorry . A: Kay , um . A: Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . A: And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . A: Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . A: Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . A: And , um So , sorry ? A: So , um , take it away Poppy . B: Okay . B: Um , do I need to plugged in . A: It's , it's plugged in . A: So , um No problem . C: F_ eight , w . C: Function F_ eight . B: F_ okay . B: Function F_ eight . B: Sorry about this guys . B: Kay . B: is on . B: Right . B: Okay . B: I will take this time just to apologise . B: I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . B: Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . B: But there we go . A: I'm sure it's fine . B: Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . B: And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . B: They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . B: So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . B: Um , from Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . B: Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . B: So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . B: And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . B: A automatically , um lights up at first touch . B: Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . B: Um , also we could use um an alarm . B: So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . B: Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . B: Um , so that would work . B: Um , oop . B: Go back there . B: Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . B: Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . B: So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . B: So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . B: So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . B: So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . B: Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . B: Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . A: Right , um , one question . B: Yeah . A: This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? B: Um And then Yeah . A: So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? B: Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . B: And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . B: I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . B: Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . A: Yeah . B: Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . A: Mm-hmm . A: Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? A: Or would we contribute to another group ? B: You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . B: But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . B: For a certain percentage at least . A: Alright . B: Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but Yeah . A: Okay . A: This sounds like a really great idea . A: One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . B: Yeah . A: Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . B: Yeah . A: You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . B: Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . B: Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . B: Because of this , their properties are smart material . B: All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . A: Mm-hmm . A: Alright . B: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but Yeah . A: We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . A: Alright . A: I like the environmental approach . A: Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . B: Okay . B: Um also there is um components . B: This'll be how it uh will actually work . B: But I haven't put this plan together yet . A: I'm sorry , could you Those were um Okay . B: There we go . B: Sorry , should I go back . B: This would actually show the circuit diagram . B: Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . B: So I just put all those components in . A: So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . A: Those are all the Alright . B: Yeah . B: I it just shows what sort of energy source . B: It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . B: Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . A: Great . B: Okay ? B: So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? B: Or escape ? B: There we go . B: Okay . A: Alright . A: Thank you very much . B: Thank you . A: And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . B: There you go Tara . C: Thanks . C: Can you see ? D: Oh , Function F_ eight . C: Do you think Is it uh , function eight yeah ? A: Yeah . B: Function F_ eight . A: Function F_ eight . A: Sorry . B: The one at the top . C: Oh right . C: Okay . D: That looks right . A: Yeah . C: Okay . C: I'm the User um User Interface Designer . C: Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . C: Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . C: By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . C: There're two functional design options . C: A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . C: And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . D: I'm sorry , what was that last one . D: Multifunctional and Ch Oh , I see . C: Sorry . C: Um , a single function just for the television itself . C: Yeah . C: Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . C: A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . D: Kay . C: Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . C: It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . C: Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . C: And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . C: And less functions would have to be included . C: So it would be cheaper to make . C: And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . C: Does anyone have any questions ? D: So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? C: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . D: Right . C: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices . D: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? D: Okay . A: Right . A: Does everyone agree with this ? A: Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? B: Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . B: And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . B: I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: And limit the design . B: Do you think ? D: Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . B: Yeah . D: So Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: That's true . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . B: Yeah . C: We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . A: Yeah . B: Okay . B: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Sounds great . D: Mm , 'kay . A: Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? D: Yes I am . A: Fabulous . A: Except you're not hooked up to the Great . D: Oh , I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Oh . D: I just lost my microphone . A: No problem , we can I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? D: Just a moment . D: Okay . D: So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . D: Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . D: Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? D: The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . D: Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . D: Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . D: Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . D: And I'll show you my findings . D: Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . D: So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . D: Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . D: So I think that should be our priority here . D: Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . D: Not just in electronic fashion . D: So that it's something that fits in the household . D: Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . A: Mm-hmm . D: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Okay , so the findings . D: Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . D: Which is a , quite a significant number . D: Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . D: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . D: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . A: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . A: You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? D: Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . D: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . A: Okay . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Um , so it is something that people care about . D: It's not , it's not ignored in the household . D: Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . D: Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . D: They're you know thumb-masters . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . D: That A very small amount . D: Thought that was interesting . A: Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . B: Mm . B: the single function . A: And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . B: Yeah . D: Yes . C: Yeah . B: Yeah that's a good point . C: Yeah . D: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . D: And uh how important the uh users find them . D: So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . D: Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . D: Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . D: So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . D: Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . D: Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . D: That's a huge amount . D: This is the most important button . D: Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . D: Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . D: Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . D: And it's used on average four times an hour . D: Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . D: Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . D: Relevance is two . D: Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . D: Um , and relevance of one point five . D: We're getting to specific statistics here . D: Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . D: I don't know if you can help me . D: Flipping pages . D: Is that So like a running banner , underneath Oh . C: It's um It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . B: It's like the news . B: Or like information . A: Yeah . B: The and what's on . A: It's um No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . C: No , li Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I haven't used it before but Mm . B: It's like It's like very basic internet . C: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . D: Okay . C: Very basic internet , yeah . B: Sort of , um Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and Yeah . D: Okay . C: But you have Yeah . D: Like tells you the weather , and Okay . C: But you have no interaction back with it , you know . C: Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . D: Right . C: Yeah . D: Alright . D: Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . D: Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . D: So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . C: Yeah . D: Um , channel settings . D: Zero point zero one times an hour . D: Relevance of three . D: Channel settings . C: Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? D: P Sorry . D: Changing the channels ? C: Tuning them in at the very start . C: You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? D: Oh , okay . B: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . D: Okay . D: Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . D: Remote controls are often lost somewhere . D: So that was already discussed by Poppy . D: How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . D: Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . D: So it should be very user-friendly , you know . D: People know what to do very quickly . D: Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . B: Repetitive strain injury . C: Repeti Uh . D: Ah . B: I think . D: Is that what it is ? D: People with arthritis and such ? A: That's rather sad . D: Um , maybe our designers can look into that . B: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . C: Yeah , yeah . B: I'm not Mm . C: I think it is . D: Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . B: Yeah . D: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . D: That's a problem . B: Yeah . B: It is . D: Okay . D: Did you guys uh get that one down ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . D: Um okay , here's some ideas for you . D: A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . D: So I'll show you some numbers here . D: Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . D: Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . D: Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . D: Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . D: So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . D: And if we have the budget for it . D: Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . D: Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . A: I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um , financially and and functionally . A: Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . B: Mm . A: Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . D: So that , that's a whole other field of research . D: I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . D: Um and depending on how many members you have in households . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . A: Yeah . A: And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . D: Right . A: Wonder if it would have Yeah . C: Yeah . B: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: If we're looking for a simplistic design , if We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . D: It looks like Mm-hmm . D: It'd be like the ultimate remote . D: Um okay . D: And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . D: So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . D: Not practical . D: Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . B: Yeah . D: So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . A: Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . D: Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . D: S Or like um Yeah . C: Mobile phone . B: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Or Like an alarm clock . D: You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . B: What , what would appear on the screen ? A: I have no idea still . A: I'm sorry . D: Oh just like an electronic screen . D: As opposed to just buttons . D: There would be like a little , like on Yeah . A: Oh , on the remote . A: Okay . D: Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . A: Yeah . D: Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . D: I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . C: Yeah . C: Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . C: But that would probably be Yeah . B: Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . D: Mm-hmm . C: That would be good , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Might be quite expensive to do that though . B: Mm , Yeah . B: Could be . D: Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . A: Right . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . D: Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . D: Um , we want something that people want in their home . D: Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . D: So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . B: Yeah . D: Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . D: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . B: Mm . D: I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . D: But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . A: Mm-hmm . C: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . D: Mm-hmm . C: Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah . D: Right . D: And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . D: I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . C: Yeah . D: Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . C: Yeah . C: Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . A: Yeah . A: And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . C: Twenties . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yep . B: Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Alright . D: Okay . B: Okay . D: That's it for the market research . A: Okay . A: Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . A: Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . A: Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . A: Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . A: Um , for many reasons . A: So um we have that decision sort of made for us . A: Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . A: And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . B: Can I just interrupt ? A: Yep . B: Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? D: Yeah . D: Maybe we can do the There you go . A: Okay , sure . A: Yeah I do . A: I'm looking at looking at it right now . B: Okay . B: Thanks . A: thank you . D: Oh , come back screen . D: Hmm . B: Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? A: Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Alright , and another thing . A: This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . A: So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . B: Right . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . B: Okay . A: Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . B: Just Okay . A: Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . B: Work on that . D: It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? A: Okay . D: Yeah , I think . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Real Reaction ? A: Okay . A: Um , yes , those are the changes . A: Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . A: I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . A: Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . A: So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . B: Okay . A: It'll It won't have teletext . A: But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . D: Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? B: Yeah . A: Is that how most people feel about that ? C: Yeah . D: Yeah ? B: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Okay . D: So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . C: I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if You'd Yeah . A: Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . D: Yeah . C: So is it just Okay . D: Never heard of it . B: Yeah . C: Alright . A: Yeah . C: Right . A: I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . A: Do you know if anywhere else has it ? C: I don't know . B: I don't know . C: I don't know . B: More research required , I think . A: Alright . B: But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay . A: It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . C: Yeah . B: So Okay . C: Okay then . A: Kay . A: So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . D: Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . B: Kay . D: Um . B: Minimal Yeah okay . D: And the What was the word they used ? D: F findability is important . A: Yeah . A: I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . B: Yeah . B: The same signalling . B: I mean Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . A: It's not that expensive to do . B: Like you just a , a buzz or something . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: I like that idea . C: Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? C: Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so you'd ha Yeah , with the button that you pressed . B: If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on Oh , yeah . A: Yeah . A: The button Oh . C: Yeah . C: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . A: Minor detail there . B: Maybe Yeah , yeah . B: Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . A: Yeah , it would have t Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Yeah , okay . C: Would it need a battery then ? A: Maybe , um Probably , I mean . B: Pr probably . B: Unless it could be Okay . A: That's your department you'll have to sort that out . D: Mm . B: Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . B: I mean the power for the T_V_ . C: Yeah . B: So , mm , more research into that one . A: Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? D: Mm . B: Yeah . A: Great . A: Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . A: Is everyone interested in that ? B: Y Yeah . D: On the buttons ? C: I I like the light up suggestion . C: I think that would be better . C: Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so I would go for Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? A: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well . D: Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . D: And there's something on it . D: S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . B: Like a raised Yeah That's true . D: Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . D: S The numbers themselves . C: Like raised . C: Yeah . D: But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . C: Could be raised . C: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? D: Yeah . A: Hmm . D: I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . D: I'm not sure . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . A: But I mean Yeah . B: Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . C: Yeah . B: The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . D: Mm-hmm . B: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . C: That , I think that's good , yeah . A: Yeah . A: Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . D: Mm-hmm . C: No , I wouldn't say so . B: No , it's not these days . B: I mean , it's quite easily accessible . A: Yeah . D: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . B: Yeah . C: That's good Yeah that a good idea . B: Yeah . D: I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . D: It lights up for On self timer . C: That , yeah , that's a good idea . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: So self-timed lighting . D: Yeah . A: Alright we have five minutes left um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . B: Um , I Yeah . A: Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . A: What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? D: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . A: Mm . A: So it could be any button that would be pressed . D: Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . B: So , self-timed Yeah . D: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . A: Yeah . D: Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . C: Yeah . A: Okay , so That's probably feasible . D: So Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? A: Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . B: I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , okay . B: And I think that's un unique as well . C: For visually impaired , yeah . B: I mean , I haven't seen that . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . A: Yeah , yeah . A: And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? B: durable . B: Oh yeah . C: Yeah . D: Oh right , the Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Repetitive strain injury . A: Yeah instead of like hard buttons . A: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? A: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? C: If I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . A: Like should we do both ? A: Or we can have one or the other ? A: Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . D: I was gonna say , Exactly . A: And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . B: Yeah . D: It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . D: It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . A: Yeah . B: Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . D: Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . D: So Mm-hmm . B: Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so Yeah . A: Right . A: Right . A: Alright . A: So we've decided on lighting up things . D: Mm . B: Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Or , or the , whate Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: But with the same thing , I mean . D: That's true . A: If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . C: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Is Are you okay with that ? C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Cool . A: Um Alright . A: So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . B: Is Okay . A: And now it's up to designing . A: And um making sure that this can be feasible . D: What um Oh sorry . A: And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ? D: Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . D: Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . D: So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . D: I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . C: Oh yeah . B: Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . D: Um Yeah , Exactly , like an iPod . C: Interchangeable thing ? A: Like an iPod or something ? C: That would be good . B: Yeah , or Okay . A: Okay . C: Yeah . D: Exactly . D: Or , or like mobile ph . A: Like a cellphone ? A: Yeah . D: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . D: Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . C: Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . D: But Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: Y Could buy extra Yeah . A: Accessories . D: Exactly . D: You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . B: Person Yeah . B: Well , that's great . C: That's a good idea . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I think that we should incorporate that . B: Interchangeable . B: Um , als Yeah . A: Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . A: You'd just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , you know . C: No . D: Mm-hmm . B: Interchan And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or Yeah . C: Oh yeah . A: Yeah . A: Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . D: Right . A: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . B: But if we , there is Yeah . C: If w No . B: We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . D: Right . A: Right . A: We'll have to do more research . A: Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . B: Yeah . A: Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? B: Um , I've Okay . A: Because we need to investigate the financial implications . A: Okay . B: Let's I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . A: Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ? A: Or should we Okay . A: Good . A: Alright then . A: Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? B: No . A: Alright , well . A: Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . C: Okay . B: Okay . A: Alright ? B: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex. The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group. They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting. *NA* The remote will be a single function design- television only. Teletext is outdated and will not be used. Remotes must incorporate corporate logo and color. No LCD, no voice recognition. Alarm locator will be implemented. Glow in the dark buttons, self-timed lighting. Will consider using number-shaped buttons. Will research changable covers. Will reserach environmental factor. Need to research on whether locator device will need a separate battery. Need to research possibility of changable covers. Need to research using envrionemntal materials.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, Tara, Poppy, Genevieve, and others gathered to discuss the design of a new remote control.

{"meeting_id":"ES2015c","dialogue":"A: Is everyone ready to start ? B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yes . A: Okay . A: Great . A: Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . A: I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . A: Okay . A: Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . A: And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . A: The meeting will be forty minutes long . B: Okay . A: And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . B: Okay . A: Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint . B: Thank you . A: Okay . B: Should be just loading . B: Okay . B: Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . B: That says go here . B: Okay . B: I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . B: Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . B: Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . B: Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . B: Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . B: Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . B: Which is where all the main information is uh contained . B: Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . B: Um , and all their positioning in the circuit . A: Um Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? B: Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . A: Yeah . B: We can go into that later . B: Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . B: And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . B: So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . A: Mm . B: Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . B: We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . B: And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . B: There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . B: A bit out of date . B: Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . A: Um What is a hand-powered dynamo ? B: Um , where you manually charge up the power . B: Like you wind up something . A: Just every , every once in a while ? B: Sorry ? A: Just every once in a while or constantly ? B: Yeah . B: Every once in a while I think . B: But it's Yeah . A: Alright . A: It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . B: It would be like going a step back in time . C: Yeah . B: I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . A: No . B: Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . B: I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . B: Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . A: Right . B: But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . B: Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . B: That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . B: Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . B: We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . B: Or too small . B: Or too slidy . B: I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . D: Mm . B: Because you can't really see which way round it is . A: Right . B: Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . B: It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . A: Mm-hmm . B: Wood . B: Um , again , stepping back in time again there . B: I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . A: Yeah . B: Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . B: But , would've been maybe for future projects . B: Um right our choice for buttons as well . B: We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . B: I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . B: You can just slide up and down . B: I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . A: It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . B: Yeah . B: That's true . B: And that would lead to an advanced yeah . B: If we have yeah . B: We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . A: Yeah . B: And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . D: Mm-hmm . B: Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . B: It's the most straightforward . B: But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . B: Got decisions to make there . B: And this is what I was just saying before . B: Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . B: Um simple would go with the pushbutton . B: Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . B: And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . A: Right . B: My personal preferences ? B: I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . B: I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . B: It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . B: And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . B: You just give it a shake . A: Yeah . B: Sounds brilliant to me . B: Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . A: Uh . B: Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . B: Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . B: And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . A: Yeah . A: Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior . B: Mm-hmm . A: This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . B: I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . B: And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . A: Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . A: It would work that way . B: Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . C: W Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . B: So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . B: Yeah . B: Like I can't think of what . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . D: Mm-hmm . C: It's yeah . A: Yeah . D: Like the skin ? D: Yeah . B: It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . A: Yeah . A: Alright . B: I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . A: So maybe the Yeah . D: Okay . B: Yeah . D: So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . B: And then yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Okay . D: And the buttons obviously are rubber . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Yeah . A: That sounds good . A: I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? B: As far as I know . B: It should be . A: Okay , we'll just say yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yes , just why not . B: Yeah , yeah . A: Alright . A: I like the kinetic energy source idea . B: Yeah . B: I thought that was Yeah . A: Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . C: Yeah , tha Backup . A: But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um energy source . D: Mm-hmm . A: It could make an we could have any kind of style . A: It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Just for environmental reasons . B: Yeah . D: I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . B: Yeah . D: So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . D: Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . B: Yeah . B: Like as a backup for something . D: Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: So , if it was running off of one battery as a Right . C: That would be good yeah . B: Yeah . B: Some alternative just in case something went wrong . C: Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . B: That's true . B: I just thought of that . B: Yeah . C: So maybe that could be incorporated as Yeah . B: Yeah . B: May maybe that could be the backup . B: Instead of a battery . A: Yeah . D: Although it needs some light , doesn't it ? B: Like solar backup . B: Yeah . C: Do , do those calculators yeah . B: I suppose s but some But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . A: Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . D: So , if we're doing yeah . D: If we're Yeah . C: I don't know how it works . B: It can be stored . B: It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . C: Yeah . B: It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . C: Yeah . B: Like a few hours a day . A: Yeah . A: I think that might be a little impractical though . D: Yeah . D: I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah . A: Yeah . B: That's true . B: It could easily Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . B: Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . A: Yeah . B: And it works . A: Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , I suppose . B: Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Cool . B: K okay . A: S that the end of your presentation . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Thank you . B: There we go . C: Thanks . C: Oh . C: It's not on my screen . C: Why ? B: it wasn't on mine either . B: I don't know why . B: I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there . C: You don't know why ? C: Oh okay . C: Is it that one ? A: Yeah . A: That's um Oh . B: Yeah . C: Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . C: Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . C: It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . C: And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . C: Um , there are two types of user interfaces . C: There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . C: So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . A: Okay . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . B: Mm . C: Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something . A: Hmm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Do you think it's Yeah . B: So I suppose sometime after you . A: Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? A: Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . A: You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . C: Yeah . B: Mm . C: So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . C: Like an L_C_D_ screen . B: I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . C: Yeah . B: And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . A: Yeah , we'll be doing Yeah . B: It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . C: Yeah . A: It'd be more a command interface , and then Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . D: So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? D: The infrared is like , that's considered a Okay . B: I For inp Mm . A: Hmm ? C: No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . D: So when it says pointing device that doesn't include Okay . A: Yeah . A: I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . C: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Yeah . C: But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . C: But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . A: What do you mean ? C: Like I can't think of an example , but Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound . A: Oh yeah , like how the buttons Yeah , as a button though . C: Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . C: Yeah , something y Yeah m perha yeah . D: Mm . A: So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: Maybe . A: Yeah . A: I like that idea . C: Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . C: As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . C: Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . C: You know , make it more trendy and original . C: We'll have more money if we keep it simple . A: Yeah . A: I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: A bit more too , yeah . C: Seeing as it's quite a new technology . C: Um We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . B: Yeah . B: That's true . C: Yeah . B: That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . C: Yeah . B: It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . C: And that all interfaces are different . C: So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . C: And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yep . C: Does anyone have any questions ? A: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . C: Mm . D: I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . D: Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: But um Yeah . A: But what about the lighting up effect ? D: You mean different colours for the lighting or Mm-hmm . A: Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . A: And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . D: Oh I see what you're saying . D: Well y Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . A: If they were white they would glow , probably . A: If they were made out of rubber . D: I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . B: Oh . D: But , but I guess , you mean from the back . A: Oh . A: Where would the light come from ? D: Okay . B: I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . D: Okay . A: Yeah . B: So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . D: Right . A: Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . B: Yeah , yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: It should be able to mm-hmm . C: In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . B: Li yeah . C: So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . C: Do you know what I mean ? D: Oh . D: Yeah . A: Oh . C: Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it . D: They , they insert over . D: Okay . C: So I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . A: Mm . C: Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Well , if they're raised up buttons . C: Yeah . A: So that you can feel them . A: We were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . D: T Okay is that my turn then ? A: Um , it might be more difficult to do . C: Yeah . A: If they're , if they're sticking up . A: If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but Yeah . C: Yeah . B: I think it would be possible . B: I don't think it would make that much difference . B: I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . B: Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . B: You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . B: And then you get to the circuit . B: I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . B: I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . A: Yeah . B: I'm sure that'd be fine . A: Okay . C: Yeah . A: Alright . A: If it's do-able we can do . A: Yeah , sounds good to me . C: So that's everything , then ? B: Okay . A: Alright , thank you . A: That means you're up . C: Yeah . D: Alright . A: Yeah . D: I have a shorter report for you today . D: Um , it took a while to get this , uh Uh . B: You're not plugged in yet . D: Oh . D: That's a very good point . D: Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . D: Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . D: Sorry . D: There we go . D: Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . D: I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . D: And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . D: Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . D: Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . D: Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . D: Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . D: Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . D: The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . D: So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . D: Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . D: And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . D: So , pretty basic there . D: And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . D: Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . D: Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . D: Um So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . D: The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . D: It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . D: I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . B: Mm . D: It could be one of the options . D: Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . D: And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . D: Mm-hmm . A: Everything else we can really , we can really um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . B: It is strange . A: But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . D: It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . C: Yeah . B: Well We I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . D: So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . A: Yeah . D: But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or Or colour schemes . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: But they still need to um fit into people's decor though . D: Right . B: Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . B: And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . B: I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . D: Yeah . D: The The essence of strawberry . C: Yeah , yeah . B: Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . B: Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . A: Yeah . B: But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . A: Yeah . B: But initially , I dunno . B: I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . A: Tone it down . D: I guess , yeah . B: Yeah and like not , not yeah . A: Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . C: Yeah . C: Or banana-shaped . D: One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . C: Yeah . D: So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . D: Because a lot of people have a house cat . D: Or , or a dog . B: Mm . D: Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . D: But it's something to keep in mind . A: Mm-hmm . D: And , did you have any questions ? D: Pretty straightforward ? B: Yeah . A: Yeah um Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . D: Okay . A: So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again . D: There you go . D: Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay . B: I didn't for the first one . B: But I have now . A: But it's still around right ? B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Uh , hopefully . C: Where do you have to save it to ? B: Project documents I think . C: Okay . A: Okay . A: I'm just trying to make this pop up now . A: Alright . A: Here we go . A: Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . A: So energy , we oh . B: Okay . B: Kay . A: Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting . A: Does anyone know how to take it out of Um , yeah . C: Just escape I think . D: The PowerPoint ? A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Um , so back to decisions . A: Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? B: Kinetic yeah . C: Yeah . A: Okay , so that's good . B: Are we going to have a backup ? A: Hmm . B: Or do we just I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . A: But would a backup really be necessary ? A: I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , if there is backup . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: I think yeah . A: There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? B: I think no . D: So So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? B: I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . A: Yeah . A: It could even be one of our selling points . B: Go for it . B: It could be fully kinetic energy . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Environmentally conscious or something . B: Is everyone happy with that ? A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Okay . C: Hope so . A: Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . A: I don't exactly know what that means . B: Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . B: And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . A: Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? C: Yeah . B: So that means we're not doing the advanced . A: Yeah . B: So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . A: I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? C: Yeah . C: I don yeah . B: Uh , so that's the simple . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? B: Yeah possibly . B: So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . A: Yeah ? B: So it's a medium . A: Okay . B: So regular chip . A: That's called medium , or regular ? B: Regular sorry . A: Kay . B: Regular chip . D: Oh , is regular not simple ? C: Yeah . B: Lighting . B: Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . C: It's for the lighting , yeah . D: Right right right . A: Okay , and cases . A: Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? B: So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . B: Rubber . C: Yeah plastic coat . B: Yeah . A: Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah , interchangeable plates . B: Plastic rubber coat . B: Interchangeable , yeah . B: Still going for that . B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: User interface concept . A: This is your time to shine . C: We decided on the component . C: I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component The command inter The command line interface yeah . B: Your screen ? D: Think it was called command interface . B: Was it Ouch . A: Oh , yeah . A: Yeah . D: Command interface , . A: Command interface . A: Did you say command line ? C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Line interface . A: Alright , and supplements . A: What's that all about ? C: Um , I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . C: Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? A: Um Mm-hmm . C: You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . C: We haven't really decided what to do about that . A: Um , what are our choices here ? C: Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . C: What kind of functions wi shall we have ? A: You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? B: The power . B: Volume . D: Mm-hmm . C: So pretty just just the basic button functions . A: Um Yeah . A: Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have Um , yeah . B: May yeah . B: Tone , contrast , and things . B: That's a bit Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l Yeah . D: That was on , um one of my presentations . D: About how often it was used . D: Do you remember that ? A: Yep . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , it was hardly ever used really . D: I w Should I bring it up ? A: Yeah . B: That would be good . A: And most televisions will come with a remote . B: Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so Mm . C: Yeah , each television . A: Yeah . A: Kay , well we know we want numbers . D: The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . D: So tw twice every once every two hours . D: Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . D: That's brightness , colour , tone , all that . C: You don't change that often , yeah . B: I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? B: I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , it does . A: Yeah , and different televisions . C: Yeah . A: Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that . B: Yeah . B: So we're just going for power , channels , volume , Mm . A: Volume . D: The other one was audio settings . D: Mono , stereo , pitch . D: I mean I sometimes use that . D: Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . C: Yeah . D: Like almost once an hour . A: Yeah . D: Um , relevance of two . A: Oh . A: We have five minutes to finish our meeting . A: Crap . A: Okay , um , let's do this fast . A: Um Should we have audio ? D: Well that didn't some up on mine . A: It only comes up on mine usually . C: It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . D: Oh . C: Do you know ? A: Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . A: Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . C: But we Yeah . A: But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . D: Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . B: I've Yeah , that's it . D: This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . C: That could be a sales pitch . B: We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Simple and Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah uh I brilliant . D: Okay . A: Alright . A: Good . A: And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . A: We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . A: Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . A: Wait a minute . A: Is that right ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . A: And you'll be evaluating the product . A: Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . A: And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . B: Okay . A: Alright . A: So , anyone else have something to say ? B: Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . B: But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? D: Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? D: Like f five different Mm-hmm . B: Y Yeah . C: Yeah . C: What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? A: five . C: Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . C: Like grapes . D: Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . C: Like that's kind of fruity or something . A: Mm-hmm . C: That's just Yeah . D: Yeah . B: We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . A: Yeah . D: I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . D: So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . B: Yeah . D: Something that your granny would want on her remote control . D: Um , and international tastes as well , so Not easy . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Tricky . B: A lot of things to consider . A: Yeah . A: Lots of yeah . B: Hm . A: Alright . B: Okay . A: Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . A: Alright . A: And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . B: Okay . C: Okay . A: Kay . D: Okay . A: Bye . B: Thank you . A: I'll see you later . A: Oh , what did I just do . A: Okay .","summary":"The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons. The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year, and says the material used is expected to be spongy. The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design, then finalizes a few decisions about the components, materials, and energy sources. The project manager closes the meeting, stating what each member's next task will be. The industrial designer will work on the look-and-feel design. The interface designer will work on the user interface design. The industrial and interface designers will be working together using modelling clay. The marketing expert will be evaluating the product. Their personal coaches will give the rest of the information Command interface is the best for a remote, so it will be used. Control will light up when you touch a button. Will use personal face places. The remote will run on kinetic energy. Push buttons will be used. Regular chip will be used. Case will be plastic and coated in rubber. Functions will be basic, including power, channels, volume. The group would like to use a fruit and vegetable theme but are not yet sure how to implement it into their product. The group was uncertain whether to add audio, because they would have to make it compatible with TVs on an international scale. They decide to eliminate it and make simplicity their sales pitch.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the third meeting of conceptual design, the team gathered to discuss crucial aspects of their remote control project. The meeting was led by A, with participants B, C, and D actively engaging in the discussions. The agenda included presentations on design progress, decisions on the remote control concept, materials, and energy sources. B presented research on internal components like circuit boards and energy sources, proposing the use of kinetic energy. They deliberated on the type of chip to use, opting for a regular one due to budget constraints. The team discussed casing materials, deciding on a plastic case with a rubber coating and interchangeable plates. C then presented the user interface concept, emphasizing a command interface for simplicity. They debated the inclusion of audio settings and the design theme, considering a fruit and vegetable motif. Action items included Poppy and Tara collaborating on the look-and-feel design, user interface design, and evaluating the product. The team agreed to explore casing ideas with a fruity theme, aiming to appeal to a younger demographic. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene in thirty minutes to further develop their innovative remote control design. The team's decisions aimed to balance functionality, aesthetics, and market appeal while considering budget constraints and design trends.","relevance":0.6017187238,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What type of energy source did the team decide to use for the remote control?","answer":"The team decided to use kinetic energy as the primary energy source for the remote control."},{"question":"What type of chip did the team opt for in the remote control design?","answer":"The team decided to use a regular chip for the remote control, as the advanced chip was beyond their budget."},{"question":"What materials were chosen for the casing of the remote control?","answer":"The team decided on a plastic case with a rubber coating and interchangeable plates for the remote control casing."},{"question":"What was the main focus of the user interface concept presented during the meeting?","answer":"The main focus of the user interface concept was on implementing a command interface for simplicity in controlling the remote."}]}
{"meeting_id":"ES2015d","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Here we go . A: Alright , the agenda for this oh . A: Alright . A: Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . A: And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . A: And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . A: I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . A: And um evaluate the product , as a group . B: Okay . A: And um So first we'll have the prototype presentation . A: Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? B: Um yeah . B: I just got a few slides , so show them . A: Alright . B: Thank you . B: Do you want to present it ? C: Um This is what we came up with . B: Yeah , here we are . C: It's a pretty simple design . C: It's um based on a mango ? C: Yeah . C: And we Yeah . A: On ? B: Mango shape . A: A mango . A: Okay . C: And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah . B: The L_E_D_ . A: Oh . A: Okay . D: I'm sorry . D: What was the where's the L_E_D_ ? A: Oops . C: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . D: Oh . D: Okay . C: And then the other one is the power . C: And uh we just have a simple design . C: We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . B: So it's palm-held . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Notice you have a number ten button . C: So you don't have to Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? C: Right no , that's a zero . B: You just need the nought . C: Take that one off . A: Okay . C: Sorry . C: I was in charge of the numbers . A: No problem . A: Ah . C: And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . B: So one plus one would be eleven , or Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . C: You can go one , three or something . A: Oh . C: You press that first and then you go one three yeah . A: You press a plus button ? A: Oh okay . A: I've never heard of that kind before . C: Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and So the plus and then yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Oh , there's no e okay . B: So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . A: Oh . A: I But Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? D: Okay . C: No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . C: These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . A: Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . C: Yeah . A: Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . C: Oh no . C: Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . A: Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? D: Sixty . C: You p Oh . C: No you press the plus first . C: I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? B: Oh . B: Well I don't mind , we can further define that . A: I th Um Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . C: It's a Yeah . B: I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . C: Yeah . A: But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . B: But I suppose it's not as snappy . D: Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . C: Oops . D: Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: If you don't put it Yeah . D: So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , that yeah . A: Yeah . D: As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: So A channel . B: Um And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like It's the bigger R_ . D: Was there so on the top there is volume and Channel up volume up . D: Okay cool . A: C_ and V_ . C: Just so we can flick It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . A: Right , where um where's the power button ? D: Yeah . D: It's the R_ . A: Oh okay . B: So it's just like . C: Yeah , so it's all accessible . A: Yeah . B: We deci Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . C: Without m taking your hand off the remote . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Oh okay . B: Uh e ergonomics are all considered . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . A: Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . B: Yeah . B: It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . C: Okay . B: But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . C: Yeah . B: Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . A: The spon yeah . C: Yeah . B: Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Bit of a stress ball feel . C: Yeah . B: Would you like to feel it yourselves ? A: Yes . B: How it fits in the palm of your hand ? A: I would . A: My goodness . A: There you go . B: Thanks . B: And you ? D: Yes . A: Genevieve ? A: Yeah . D: Oh it's nice . D: Oh I think I killed the five . D: I did . D: I killed the four . A: And something hmm . D: Oh god . B: O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . D: Oh it smells good . C: Of Play Doh yeah . B: But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . B: Or the combination . B: Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . A: Oh right . C: Cause it'd be quite subtle and Yeah . A: Yeah . A: It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would . B: Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . A: Okay yeah . B: So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . B: I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal . A: Kinda Christmas , you know . C: Yeah , yeah , yeah . B: Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki Yeah . A: Yeah . C: The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . A: Cool . B: Okay . B: Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . C: Yeah . B: Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . A: Alright , thank you very much . A: Good work everyone . D: Bravo You want the I don't know what order it goes in . A: Alright . A: And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . B: Mm-hmm . A: So , I have something I'm going to Oh wait a minute . A: Do you need to do a presentation first ? A: Yeah . A: I'm gonna check that out for a second . D: I have one . B: Mm go Feel I think . A: What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right . D: Evaluation cri Okay . A: Evaluation criteria is next in line . D: That's me . A: Yeah . D: Hello . D: Oh there we go . D: Okay . D: Come on my computer . D: Come on . D: Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . A: Just press um function eight again . D: Should I press it again ? D: Last time I did that it sh Okay . D: You're right . A: And then again I think . A: One more time . D: Oh . D: Still not there . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . D: Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . D: Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . D: Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . D: Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . D: So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . D: Okay so question number one . D: Does the remote whoops . D: Sorry . D: Oh I'm not gonna be able um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . D: I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . A: Okay . D: I'll write down our scores up on the Okay so number one . A: Ooh . D: Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? C: Mm . B: We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and Yeah . A: Yeah . A: The look is a little bit more playful . C: Well Yeah . D: Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . D: It's not your traditional yeah . A: Oh definitely different yeah . B: I think the colour has a lot to do with it . B: I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . A: Oh you were only given red and black ? A: Oh okay . C: Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . B: Um But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something Well I know know it's for rubber . D: Yeah . C: So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: A metallic-y finish we were thinking . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Polished . B: I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . C: Okay Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: I kinda I like the potato look . A: It's mango . D: It's very different . B: Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . C: We we were we were thinking about yeah . D: It's what ? A: It's mango . D: Oh sorry the mango the mango look . B: Potato's fine . D: Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . B: Potato's fine . B: Yeah . B: Totally . B: It's really adaptable . D: So I myself would say a one or a two . A: Yeah . A: I would say two . A: Personally . C: I w I'd say two I think . D: It's a two ? D: Okay , and p One being true . B: For the fancy I uh two , three . C: Fanciness . A: Yeah . D: So Two . D: Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . C: Yeah . D: Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? D: So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . A: Yeah . B: Yeah and the use of the rubber . D: Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . C: Yeah . B: For the anti-R_S_I_ . A: Yeah . B: The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . D: Isn't Mm-hmm . C: Mm . A: Yeah . B: In some aspects it is , like we said . A: Yeah . A: I'd say maybe three . C: I'll go for three as well . D: Yeah . D: And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . B: Yeah . C: No . A: Yeah we want it simple . B: Though it was our specification . C: Wouldn't be simple , yeah . D: So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: We didn't want it any more than that . D: Okay question number three . D: Uh , will it be easy to use ? A: I think so . B: Yeah . C: Yeah very . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: I think one for that . D: S Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: One . C: Yeah . C: No . D: I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . A: Th The plus number thing . C: Yeah that's the only thing yeah . D: But once that's figured out , it should be fine . B: Yeah and perhaps the turning on but Mm . D: Number four . D: Is this a good-looking remote ? D: Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . B: Again I think the colour comes into this . C: It's definitely Yeah . A: Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . D: Mm-hmm . A: I think that the logo could be smaller . B: Okay . A: And maybe not such a prominent way . C: But the Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . A: Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . B: Not in Don't worry . D: Whoops . A: Oh it just had to be on there I guess . D: Should just not touch it . C: Yeah . D: This time it's the three I killed . D: I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . D: Or Well Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . B: I suppose I've got quite big hands . A: I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . C: Yeah . C: But you know what I've just thought of there now . C: What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? C: Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? A: Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like round . C: Yeah . C: But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . D: Oh . D: That's true . A: It would still be comfortable I think . B: Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . A: We c we could handle it I think . D: Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Like that . C: Oh that would be nice . A: Ah it'd fall over all the time though . A: It'd be annoying . B: Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . C: Yeah . D: I g If it's weighted maybe . B: H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . D: Details , details . A: Kay we're done designing . D: Okay . A: Come on . D: So , is this a good-looking remote ? D: Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? C: Three . C: You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . D: Yeah . A: I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . A: I think maybe a two . D: Yeah ? D: I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but Yeah . B: I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . C: Yeah . D: Okay , so should we say two for that ? A: Sure . B: Yeah . D: Yeah ? C: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Uh , question number five . D: What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? D: Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . C: I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . A: Yeah . C: We have to market it . D: Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . B: Yeah . B: And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no . C: And the kinetic energy part . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Shake it and the buttons fall off . A: Durable . C: Don't shake Oh no the plus . B: But you know , those'll be firmly on . C: You're use the zero . D: No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ? C: Make a new one . A: But you're our Marketing Expert . C: I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? C: About ten pounds . D: But you don't have to buy batteries . C: Fifteen ? D: So in the long term this can actually save you money . C: Yeah . B: Mm , yeah , that's true . A: Oh . D: So we'll market it that way too . A: Exactly . B: Yeah . A: Exactly . D: So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll Yeah . B: Good point . A: Yeah . A: I would give it a two still though . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Mm . D: Okay number six . D: Can someone read it out ? D: Or Um yeah . B: Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . A: Mm . C: Yeah . D: So that was mainly that the statistics we said Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: I think it does very well . A: Oh yeah . B: Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . C: The zap yeah . B: And it's just you won't have to think about it . A: Yeah . B: You don't have to look down to find them . B: They're clearly there , easy to use . A: Yeah . D: Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . B: Simple . C: Uh Yeah . B: Yeah . D: But they're not you and I really . B: Mm . D: So . A: Yeah . D: Okay so one ? B: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Number seven . D: C Heather could you push it down ? D: Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? D: Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . D: Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? A: We have the alarm system . C: Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra It'll be again in the marketing . B: It Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . B: But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . A: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . C: Yeah . C: The light it will . A: Or or was it gonna make a noise ? C: But But both Yeah . B: Yeah . B: But when the alarm's not yeah . B: If you Yeah . A: You press the button it makes a noise right ? D: It turns into a duck and starts quacking . B: You could s Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Here I am . A: Awesome . C: Oh , that would be brilliant . A: Awesome . C: I'd be tempted to Yeah . B: Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . D: Um Okay . B: But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . B: So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . C: It would have to be in the market Yeah but you still couldn't see it . A: I though w it was gonna make a noise . B: Yeah . B: Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . C: It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . A: Okay . D: We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . B: Yeah . D: But yeah , it'll be there . B: Yeah . D: So we can we could say that We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . A: Oh okay . B: It w yeah . A: Whoo . A: Okay . B: Sorry . A: Yeah , totally . B: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Um Question number eight . B: Sorry Heather . B: That wasn't very clear . A: No problem , mm . D: Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? D: Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . D: So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . A: Totally . C: So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ? D: The plus thing needs to be worked on . A: Yeah . B: Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . D: Yeah . D: Well Do Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? C: Yeah . D: So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . A: Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . C: That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why . B: Mm . A: Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . D: You could just press six enter , or one two enter . C: Oh okay . B: And or sixty six enter , y Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . A: And then like twelve , enter . C: Right . C: Alright , aye . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Good Ooh . C: Yeah . D: Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? C: I'd say w yeah one . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Okay . B: Mm . D: Question number nine . B: Oh . D: Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? C: Yeah . B: Injury . D: Um , which affected over a quarter of users . D: S It's soft , and And people could Mm-hmm . C: Hmm . A: I think so . A: It's like right in the Your thumb might get a little bit uh Yeah . C: But if you're zapping yeah . B: Yeah , that's what I was thinking . C: I don't think it will f Yeah , the biology . B: We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . A: But it is soft . B: Mm-hmm . A: And that's kind of what the um the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , so maybe it is but Yeah . C: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: I don't know what other options there are . B: I think we're getting that's true . D: Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . D: But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . B: Mm . D: So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: So , one or two do you think ? C: I I'd say t two . B: I think yeah , I think too . C: Yeah . D: Two okay . A: Yeah . D: Okay number ten . D: Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? A: Yes we did . C: Yeah . D: Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? D: Is the yellow Mm-hmm . C: N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . C: It won't stand out . C: So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . D: It sounds like the colour's something that we But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . A: Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . B: Yeah . C: Gray , yeah . A: So it could be grey on the banana one . C: Yeah , could be grey . A: Yeah . C: Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea Yeah . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . D: Okay . C: Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . A: Mm , yeah . C: No ? D: Yeah . C: That isn't rubber . D: And the buttons in the middle . D: Okay . B: Yeah . D: So , do you think that's more of a three then ? D: Three , four ? B: Four I think . D: Four ? B: Well I don't what do what Okay . D: Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a a four ? A: Hum . C: Okay . D: Okay , and final question . D: Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? D: Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . A: I would say so . C: Following that briefing we did . A: But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: With the with the colours . B: Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . C: Yeah . D: No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? D: I think I missed a few they are ? C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: So you can have banana and kiwi and okay . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more Mm-hmm . A: That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . B: It is . C: I think w yeah , I think one . C: Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . C: Well we haven't got a big banana but Oh yeah . B: The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . A: Be like Yeah . C: No . C: No . A: Maybe if it was scented . B: Oh yeah . C: Oh that would be class . B: There we go . B: That would be great . A: Yeah we have money for that . A: Um Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? B: Um Okay . D: Yes we do . D: So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? D: A two for fashion ? A: Oh . A: I would say two . C: Yeah . C: Two . D: Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is Between okay . C: It's Yeah . A: One point nine or something ? B: It's Between one and two . A: I don't know these things . A: Um , between one and two . B: So that's pretty fantastic . C: Close to two . D: Um . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . C: I got Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . A: Alright . D: Does that seem right then ? D: Okay . B: Mm . B: It seems like it should be more around two . C: Uh , aye . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Uh , should've added five . B: Do we have an online calculator ? A: I'm attempting to do that right now . B: Okay . C: This is . A: Yeah it is one point nine . A: Ooh . C: Yay . B: Oh wow . B: Well done . A: Go Heather Pauls . B: Well that's excellent . A: Yeah . A: Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . A: And um my computer's frozen . A: And now it's not . A: Okay . A: So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um I'm going to um steal a cable . D: Sorry . D: Are you gonna do that ? D: Okay . A: Um it's it's um it's an Excel file . C: Is that the project document ? A: Oh . B: Production costs . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Kay there we go . A: Um , production costs . A: And um I have to access that as well . B: It says it I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . A: One moment . A: Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on ? A: Great . A: It's blinking at me . A: It's locked for editing . A: Read only . A: I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . A: I have the original in my um my email account . D: Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? A: I dunno . D: Or okay . B: Have you have you completed it ? A: No . B: Oh right . A: No , I was hoping that you guys could . B: Okay . B: Okay . A: Um , there we go . A: Okay here we go . A: So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . A: So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . B: Yeah . A: Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . B: Yeah . C: Oh right . A: Um we're using a regular chip . B: Yeah . A: Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . B: Double double-curved yeah . A: That's another three . A: We're already at five . A: Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . B: Yeah . A: Um S Yeah . C: What about a special colour ? C: Are we using that ? A: I guess we should do it just for one kind . B: Yeah . A: So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right ? B: Yeah . A: Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . B: Mm-hmm . A: So we can Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . C: Yeah . A: And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . A: And a special material . C: And a special material . C: Yeah . B: Oof . A: Which puts us just barely under budget . A: Hurray . B: Congratulations guys . D: Mm . D: S good . A: Yeah . A: Good work guys . A: So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . C: That's good . A: Awesome . A: And back to our PowerPoint . A: So we've 'Kay . A: Yes we are . A: So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um I dunno . A: A different extension of a Hmm . B: Of the actual project rather than the product ? C: Yeah . B: A project ? B: Is is yeah . A: Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . B: So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . A: Yeah . A: Alright so um Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? B: I think we were pushed . D: Mm-hmm . A: Pushed for creativity ? B: I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . C: The ma Or materials . C: Yeah . B: So I think we could've done with a bit more time . A: Ye Okay . A: So it'd be like need more time and materials . B: Yeah . A: But you were allowed m creativity ? B: Yeah . A: I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ Right . D: Yeah and the conceptual and functional . D: Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m When we can down to it . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . C: Yeah . D: Okay . B: So that did limit creativity . C: Creativity . A: Right Okay Great . B: Just resources . D: Mm-hmm . B: But yeah . B: The fruit and veg idea . A: Leadership ? A: Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? D: Yeah . A: Um . D: Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . C: Yeah . B: Yeah we did . A: Yeah . B: We've , uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended . B: A pro um a product within the budget . B: I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know I think it's been fine . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: And the timing was good . D: We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so Was good teamwork . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Good timing . A: Oop Okay . B: And project manager of course . A: Teamwork ? A: I think we worked great as a team . B: Yeah . A: Yeah ? C: Yeah . D: I think we are well-suited to our roles . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Alright how were our means ? B: Um Yeah and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . A: We needed more Play Doh colours . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . C: Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . D: Oh really ? D: Okay . A: But ever everything else was satisfactory ? A: Is that good Yeah ? D: Yeah . D: The computer programmes are good . C: Yeah . D: The Yeah . B: Yeah . B: It could be really straightforward for the computer . D: I don't think there was anything Yeah . B: I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . C: I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . B: Mm . D: They'll probably still be there . B: Uh me too . B: Yeah . A: New ideas found . A: I don't really know what that means . D: Um I'm not sure , new ideas found . B: Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um yeah . C: Yeah . C: Through discussion . B: Just about each different . B: Got new ideas from each other . A: Hmm ? D: Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah , worked well . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: And we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Each other's Mm . D: Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? B: Sorry ? D: Does it have smart materials ? B: Oh yeah . D: Oh yeah . B: Well mm , did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs . C: If if it if it If it can be afforded . A: Okay ? A: Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . A: Yes our costs are within budget . B: Yes . A: It's evaluated generally positively . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . A: Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea . B: Uh . C: Yay . B: Fantastic . D: By watching T_V_ ? B: Okay , brilliant . A: Alright ? C: Yeah . B: Thank you very much . A: Okay , bye . D: Mm . D: Conclusion ? D: Dadada .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme. The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto. They average the scores and get 1.9. They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had. They close the meeting by thanking one another. *NA* Numbers have a circular design. Casing will be interchangable and color schemes will be named and colored after fruits and vegetables. Will be two colors, one for case and one for buttons. Will use a regular chip. The remote will be double-curved. Will be made of plastic and rubber (rubber on remote for comfort). Product costing is 1.20 Euros. *NA*.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the agenda included a prototype presentation by two designers, followed by an evaluation based on specific criteria and a discussion on finances to ensure staying within budget.

{"meeting_id":"ES2016a","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Oh , that's not gonna work . A: Oh , alright . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Um alright . D: Uh , uh , um . A: I'll just put that there . A: Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . A: Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . A: Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . A: Go ahead . D: Okay . D: I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . D: In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . D: In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . D: And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . A: Kay . C: Hiya , I'm Ryan . C: Um I'm the User Interface Designer . C: Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . C: Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . C: Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . C: And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . C: That's about it . B: Right . B: I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . B: In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . B: Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . B: Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . C: Yeah . B: And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . A: Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . A: Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . A: Um so we are putting together a new remote control . A: Um we want it to be something original . A: Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . A: Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . A: And w uh well um functional design um . A: Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . C: Yeah . C: Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . A: So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? C: Oh right . C: I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . A: Kay . D: Mm . C: But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . A: Mm-hmm . A: Kay . C: I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . B: Mm . C: But is it just infra-red ? C: Is that standard ? A: I I think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . C: Ye yeah . A: Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so I think we're all in the same boat here . D: Huh . D: Ours too . A: Um Okay . C: Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . D: Mm . C: So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . D: Ch Like a tracking device ? A: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh like a tracking device or or like a a It makes a noise , there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and 'Kay . C: Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep . B: Mm , mm . D: Mm . C: Yeah . B: Right . D: Be good . B: So Mm . C: Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . A: Yeah . C: Just long . A: Do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular . C: Yeah . A: Do we want something crazy ? C: Black usually . A: You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . C: Yeah . D: Lot more modern . C: I think so . A: A m a modern so our remote should be 'Kay . C: Maybe sorta spherical or something . C: A ball . D: Maybe like user-friendly , like a little you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . C: Yeah . C: People I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . D: Mm . A: Um . B: Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . C: Yeah . B: Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . D: Mm . B: What are we gonna build that thing out of ? B: How sturdy is it gonna be ? B: Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? A: Okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it 'Kay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . A: Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um So our form and our function . A: Um we want it to be um easy to find . A: Um What else it what else do we want it to to do ? A: So we want it to be universal . A: It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . D: Mm . D: Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . A: Kay . D: That's more on the research end , but the marketing . A: So marketing , you know , how maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . D: Yeah . D: And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . A: Kay . C: Ye Small . B: Right . A: Um Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? A: Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . A: Some ideas ? A: We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . C: I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea . C: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . C: If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . C: Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . C: Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . C: Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . C: It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . C: But yeah . D: Futuristic . C: That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about Right , it would almost be like a ball . A: Uh-huh . C: So that was just just an idea I had . C: I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? B: Right . B: One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Maybe f yeah . B: That's one of the big issues . C: Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . B: Also also you risk the hinges here . C: Yeah . B: That's that's um a problem . C: The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though . B: That's that's interesting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah . C: Yeah . A: How would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? A: What I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? A: Not to put you on the spot , but What did you say your title was again ? B: E No no , uh uh . B: N n Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is that well maybe I dunno . A: You're the the Industrial Designer . B: The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . A: Okay . B: As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . C: Well I I suppose that things become design . D: Mm-hmm . C: But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . C: I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . A: Yeah . A: It's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um . C: Yeah . D: Kay , I'll draw something . A: So if no , go ahead . D: What ? D: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . C: Yeah . D: But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . D: We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . D: I don't know . D: That's my idea . C: I think definitely doing something different is a good idea . D: Yeah . B: Mm . C: I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . A: Something with a grip . D: Mm . C: Yeah , with a grip . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Because even I suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . C: It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . B: Mm . A: So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . C: Like yeah . A: But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . C: Yeah . D: True . C: It's d yeah . C: I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . D: Mm . A: Uh um Yeah . D: That's fine . D: You're the boss , you're allowed to . B: Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . B: So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . D: Yeah . B: So for that there's So The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? A: Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . A: Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . A: Let's see here . A: What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . A: So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . C: Yeah . A: Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . A: Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . A: So the grip is No , that wouldn't work either um . A: But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . A: So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then flat uh And then we have the problem with the hinge . A: So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . A: Mm , that's true . B: It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . B: From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . B: So it's don't make it too stable uh . A: So we don't have it flip open . A: We just have a ball Okay , so then we forget the ball . C: But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . B: To the other design . B: It looks cool . D: Looks cool though . A: It looks cool , but it's really not it's not functional um . D: Yeah . B: Uh functional . A: So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . A: What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . A: Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . A: Course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . C: Yeah . B: Right . B: Right . A: But it's one-handed um . B: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? B: W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . B: So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . D: Mm . A: Yeah . B: Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . A: Yeah . D: Right . B: Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . A: Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . B: You know , all that dif batteries right , and Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? B: So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . A: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? A: So that either way you're pointing it it would work . B: I suppose you could do that . B: O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . A: More expensive and yeah . B: Course you can do that . A: Kay . A: Um True . B: I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . C: Put it Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . B: Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . C: So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . D: Yeah . A: Kay . D: Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . C: Um Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . A: Are we out of time ? D: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some Are good ideas , what are not . B: Let's . B: Obviously Alright . A: Uh . A: Must finish now , so . A: And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . D: Mm . D: Great . A: Okay . A: And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . A: And uh alright , good meeting .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project.

The team discussed universal usage, how to find remotes when misplaced, shapes and colors, ball shaped remotes, marketing strategies, keyboards on remotes, and remote sizes. The marketing expert will find out what the most universally appealing remote control on the market is. The marketing expert will research user preferences The remote will sell for 25 Euro. The team will not create a ball shaped remote. The stability of a ball shaped remote. Having hinges on a ball shaped remote. What shape the remote should be.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, Nick Debusk, the Project Manager, gathered Corinne Whiting, the Marketing Expert, Ryan, the User Interface Designer, and Manuel, the Industrial Designer, to brainstorm ideas for a new remote control. They aimed to create a trendy, user-friendly, and sturdy product with a target selling price of \u20ac25 and a revenue goal of \u20ac50 million. The team discussed various design concepts, including a ball-shaped remote with grips for better handling and a keyboard-style layout for functionality. They debated the balance between stability and design, considering the need for a flat bottom to prevent rolling and the challenge of incorporating sensors for intuitive use. Action items included further design exploration, market research for global appeal, and planning for the next meeting. Despite time constraints, they agreed to refine their ideas and reconvene, with the Project Manager tasked with better meeting preparation. The meeting concluded with a sense of progress and anticipation for the next steps in developing the innovative remote control.","relevance":0.4512968659,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the target selling price for the new remote control?","answer":"\u20ac25"},{"question":"Who was the Project Manager in the meeting?","answer":"Nick Debusk"},{"question":"What was one of the design concepts discussed for the remote control?","answer":"A ball-shaped remote with grips for better handling"},{"question":"What action item was mentioned for the Marketing Expert?","answer":"Market research for global appeal"}]}
{"meeting_id":"ES2016b","dialogue":"A: Oh . C: Du Uh we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . A: Okay . A: Thanks for coming to this meeting . D: Hm . A: S how we doing on our remote ? A: We have some we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want . A: Yeah . C: I think . A: Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . A: See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . A: Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . A: Then I believe each of you have a presentation . A: Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . A: Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . A: And uh then we'll have the closing . A: Um which we'll have forty minutes for . A: Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . A: I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . A: Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . A: She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . A: Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer . A: And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . A: So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . A: Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . A: Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . A: Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . A: Um and we want to be different . A: Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . A: Ball-shaped phone . A: The keyboard shape . A: Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . A: Something we could use with one hand . A: Um and that was our last meeting . A: So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation ? D: Yep . A: Okay . A: I'll hand it off to you and um Does anyone do you wanna go first ? D: Sure . A: So we can maybe see what uh what the people want . D: What was it ? D: Function ? B: Eight . D: F_ eight ? B: F_ eight . D: Well . D: How do I get it Oh right right right . C: Slide show . A: To go to the next one ? A: Yeah you click on that guy . D: That one ? A: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Alright . D: Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . D: Oh gosh , I've no idea . D: G Okay . C: Just press the arrow keys I think . C: Usually goes to it . D: Sorry I actually need to see something else on my screen . A: Hit F_ eight again . D: Yeah . A: I think . D: And then ? D: Again ? A: Yeah . A: You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ? D: No I want something else on mine . D: Is that possible ? A: Yeah but I think you have to hit escape . A: And then you can Yeah . D: Okay but now you don't have that . A: Oh hit F_ eight again . D: Sorry guys . A: I know . A: I did the same thing . A: And then it should come up here shortly . A: Kay . D: So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and have something yeah . A: I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? D: Yeah . D: Oh well . A: Mm . A: I'm not sure . A: You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think . D: Yeah . D: It's okay . D: Okay . D: Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . D: And then some internet research . D: And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . D: And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . D: Um okay here are some of the findings . D: They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . D: And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . D: Which is a fairly significant number I would say . D: And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . D: So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . D: Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . D: Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . D: And if anyone could clarify what that means ? D: Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? C: Is is it j just just just using it yeah . B: Just jus yeah . D: Okay . D: Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . D: And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . D: And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . D: Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . D: And then teletext was the next . D: Volume and then power . D: And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . D: So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . D: Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . D: They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . D: And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . C: A repetitive strain injury . D: What is it ? C: Just repetitive strain injury . C: I think . D: Okay . C: That's what I guess . D: Okay . D: And so bas okay . D: Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . D: From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . D: And it kind of just went down incrementally . D: The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . D: At least if we're targeting the younger groups . D: And so in conclusion . D: Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . D: We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . D: Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . D: So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . D: Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . D: And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . D: And that's it . A: Kay . A: Very nice . A: Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . A: Uh Wait can I look at that real quick ? D: Oh yeah . D: Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? C: Yeah . D: Kay . C: Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . C: Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . C: Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . C: Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . C: And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . C: I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . C: Um I had some things sent to me . C: Not very much . C: To look at similar devices . C: Um defined in some them . C: And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . C: Um we discussed a universal one . C: Um like it's just been brought up again then . C: But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . C: I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . C: You have to set them , reset them to everything . C: Um and that would only add buttons . C: Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . C: So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . C: Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . C: Um Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . C: They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . C: But one is uh user-centred . C: That is the one on the left . C: And you can straight away see there's less buttons . C: And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . C: Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . C: And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . C: Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . C: Um Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . C: Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . C: So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . C: And then and change the fashion of remote controls . C: And that's it . B: cable there . B: Thank you . A: What was your last conclusion on that one ? A: Focus on uh the i the image of it . C: On something on the image of it . C: Uh the f the actual design . A: Kay . A: Good . A: Good . B: Okay . B: Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . B: Right . B: So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so um I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . B: Um just This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . B: Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . B: Okay so much is clear . B: An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . B: Often in the form of infrared bits . B: This is the most mostly used . B: Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . B: Um parts are cheaper as well . B: A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . B: This is where my people screwed up basically . B: So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . B: Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . B: We'll start with an energy source . B: Right . B: Um which is usually a battery right ? B: Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . B: This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . B: Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . B: Right ? B: This is the user interface and there we have the chip . B: Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . B: That sends out the signal . B: Of course the signal differs accordingly . B: Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . B: And Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . B: The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . B: You press something , you get a response . B: Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . B: Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . B: The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . B: What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . B: We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . B: Right ? B: These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . B: Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . B: It c it doesn't have to be there . B: This can be discussed as well . B: The user interface . B: That's something we can also discuss . B: Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . B: Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . B: Or if we just do the usual button thing . B: Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . B: And of course the energy source . B: Batteries . B: Solar cells . B: Who knows ? B: Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . B: But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to to the industrial design department . A: So we could the the the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . B: Expensive it's gonna be get uh . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: So possibly it might be worth the investment . B: Right . C: I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . C: Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone . D: Yeah . A: I agree . C: And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well . A: Well I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . A: Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . A: Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . C: Yeah . A: I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . C: Yeah . A: So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you Volume up . C: And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . C: If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting Yeah . A: Volume down . A: Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? A: I I don't know . D: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . D: Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . C: I think As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . C: But practically I don't think it's Yeah . A: It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and Okay . C: It'll wear off . D: Gets old yeah . A: Um Let's see here . C: Do you wanna put your cord back in ? A: Yeah I guess so . B: Oh right . A: Trade you . B: go . A: Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . A: Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . A: And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . A: I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . D: Mm . A: So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . A: Um no teletext . A: Um So we don't have to worry about that . A: Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . A: And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . A: And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . A: Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . A: Um We want something that looks good . A: Um we want something that's simple . A: We want something that you can find easily . A: Um And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . A: It's gonna cost more . A: S the young the younger people say that they like it . B: Mm-hmm . A: But um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . A: So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . A: Um And that way we can focus on our form . C: I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . C: Is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . C: Um that you you should put it back in . C: Your remote . C: But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . C: Just by infrared . C: That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . A: That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . C: Yeah it would be quite good . C: The ball could sit on a Yeah . A: Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good . D: Mm . A: You know that could be the charger . A: For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . A: And that would be or solar . A: Or you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . C: Yeah . A: Um With the locator button . A: Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . C: Yeah . A: Um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and It's gonna roll away . B: Well you still do . B: You s you still W yeah . B: You put it on t on the couch table . B: While you're watching , it's gonna roll off . D: Rolls away yeah . B: So that's not an issue really . A: Um So I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . A: And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . A: Um then we'll take lunch . A: Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . A: Um I'll do the minutes . A: Uh let's see . A: It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . A: Um chips , the what chips we need and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . A: User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . C: Yeah . A: Um Minimal number of buttons . A: I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . C: Yeah . B: Right . B: That's Mm . A: Did you have time earlier to to work on that . A: Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? D: Not really . C: I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . A: Kay . C: I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . C: The ball is probably not a good idea . D: Mm . C: And even something that's held like that might be difficult . A: Mm-hmm . C: So that I think it still has to be a variation . C: On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . D: Mm . A: Um Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? A: That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . A: Or girls or older people ? A: Um Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ? A: That we would would wanna pick out ? C: D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . D: Mm . C: I find anything more on that . D: Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . A: Kay . A: So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . C: Yeah . A: Um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . A: And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom or the you know . C: Bottom perhaps yeah . A: Um Maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . A: You know . A: Um maybe we could flare it or something . A: You know . A: So it's more of course this will look like a bone then . A: go ahead and erase this . A: Um Hope everyone memorised that uh Yeah . C: You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . D: Mm . A: Yeah . C: They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . A: Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? A: Except for me now . A: Uh But they are all , you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . C: Yeah . A: Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . D: Mm . B: Right . A: But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . A: Um So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . A: Um Maybe we could go with a square or something . A: Um Um you know with minimal number of buttons . B: Hm . A: I guess you've got you know one through nine . A: For typing in your channels . A: Uh you've got volume , up and down . A: Channel up and down . D: Power . A: Power . A: Usually at the top . A: Um a mute . B: That's the classical design . A: That's that's pretty much all you need I think . A: Um A menu button , maybe . B: Right . A: So you know . A: If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Um 'Kay so Um Mm-hmm . B: Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . B: It's Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . B: Which is technically the easiest option . B: Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Like a wheel on your mouse . B: So . B: Yeah , sort of like that . A: Sort of . B: You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . B: Right . A: S a good idea . B: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . B: Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on . A: Mm-hmm . B: I know . B: You know what I'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side . A: Look g yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Looks good . B: It's like that . B: Right . B: Uh Then you hold it in your hand like this . B: And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . C: Yes s To the thumb yeah . A: To the thumb . A: Yeah . B: Right . B: Mm . C: Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . B: Right . B: You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . C: Yeah . B: With the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part . C: Behind . C: Definitely . B: And out . C: just like o on a sort of side view . C: Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . C: So you know you just sort of have your hand Yeah . B: Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . C: Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing . C: Yeah that's also true . B: So . C: instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . B: Right . C: But I mean the older so Right-handed , yeah . A: Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? D: Right . A: You guys all right-handed ? B: Right . A: Yeah . A: So I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . D: Uh-huh . B: That's right . A: Like the written language . A: Or English . D: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . A: Maybe . A: Ow . D: Special order . A: I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . D: Yeah . A: Um but that's that's good . A: That's w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . A: Um At least for what buttons we're gonna use . A: Um So we've got uh I like the scroll , the scroll action and the . C: I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . C: So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . C: And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . C: And that I think could work . A: Yeah . C: On any hand . A: Kinda like holding a Yeah . C: If you just had it like wrapped round there . C: Left or right . D: Mm . B: Right . B: That minimises it size-wise as well . C: Minimise its size . C: It could be you know really quite small . B: Mm . B: Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . B: If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . B: You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . C: Yeah . D: Hmm . B: Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . C: Zapping functions . B: That's it . D: Could be good . B: Maybe . A: So two remotes in one . A: But then would be easier to lose one or the other . B: That's right . B: Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . B: And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around . B: Make it a piece of furniture . D: Yeah , yeah . A: It actually is your coffee table . B: yes . B: Yes , there you go . B: Or a statue or something . A: Okay . A: Well we need to finish up here . A: Um So for the next So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yep . A: Um Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . B: Right . A: Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . A: So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . B: Alright . C: Yeah . A: Um And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . C: How well it'll work yeah . A: So both of those concepts . A: And uh okay I think we made some good progress here . B: Alright . A: see you in I dunno . A: I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . A: Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting . C: Yeah . B: Alright . A: Okay .","summary":"The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls. The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive, to match the behavior of the user, to be easier to locate when misplaced, and not to cause RSI. The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition. The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include.

{"meeting_id":"ES2016c","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Right . A: Okay . A: Alright . A: Is everyone here ? D: Yep . C: Yep . A: Okay . A: This is our conceptual design meeting . A: And I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . A: Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . A: And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . A: Um I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . A: Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . A: Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . A: Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . A: Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . A: People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . A: Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . A: Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote . A: Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . A: Um And uh some sort of locator . A: Either a button or tracking device . A: Um And that it should look different than what's out there . A: Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . A: The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . A: Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . A: Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . A: Um the simple versus the um the complex . A: The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . A: Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . A: Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . A: Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . A: Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . A: Have it s be something that looks different . A: And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . A: Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . A: Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . A: Um How that would power the remote and the lamp . A: If we were to to have one . A: Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . A: Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . A: Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . A: And with a , just a few buttons . A: Just the basics . A: And with a scrolling um function also . A: Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . A: So Marketing ? D: Okay . A: We're watching trends . D: Yep . D: Can I have your cable please ? A: I suppose that you can have this . D: Thanks . D: Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . D: Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . D: I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . D: And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . D: Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . D: Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . D: And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . D: And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . D: As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . D: So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . D: Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . D: Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . D: Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . D: But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . D: Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . D: We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . D: And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . D: We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . D: Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . D: I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . C: Oh it was sort of banana shaped . D: Yeah . A: A banana shape ? D: Yeah . D: Right . D: Or with exterior designs . D: But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . D: So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . D: And then the spongy feel . D: I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . D: C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . D: So that's that . A: So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . B: Alright . A: Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? D: That's what I was thinking yeah . C: Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . A: You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it . D: Yeah . D: So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings . A: You can Mm various covers . C: What's it called ? C: Cust you personalised , yeah . D: Personalise your remote . A: We could leave that to the cover department . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: We all know they've got nothing to do all day . C: Okay . C: Why can't I see the crazy . C: Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . C: Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . C: But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . C: Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . C: They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . C: Um okay . C: There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . C: Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . C: A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . C: Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . C: You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . C: So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . C: Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . C: Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . C: I have a there is a picture . C: You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . C: Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . C: And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . C: So the technology is there . C: Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . C: You can sort of just make those out . C: And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . C: That is a possibility . C: And nothing's simpler really . C: Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . C: So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . C: And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . C: So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . C: Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . C: Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . C: Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . C: Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . C: Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . C: And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . C: Um I don't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . C: Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . C: And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . C: And that is it . C: Why am I Oh yeah . C: Just . C: Where are we ? C: Uh . C: Just to sort of show you . C: M they've even got things like that . C: Huge things . C: Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? B: That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Dunno . C: And that yeah . B: Makes sense , makes sense . A: Notice the giant dog bone shape ? A: Also good for animals . C: Yeah . C: See . C: things . C: Why's my screen crazy ? B: Uh Well let's see . B: I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . B: Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . B: I've more information on possible materials um as well . B: What we can and cannot do . B: Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . B: Okay . B: The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . B: The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . B: Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . B: Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . B: When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . B: The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . B: It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . B: Right . B: Pretty clear . B: Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . B: The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . B: This is the circuit board from the other side . B: Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . B: Um you can see the circuit board itself . B: That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . B: Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . B: These are the actual keys that are being pressed . B: They close the electric circuit . B: That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . B: That would be behind here . B: Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . B: Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . B: Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . B: The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . B: And thus gives on the signal . B: Now this is the simple version . B: Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . B: We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . B: And not only that . B: Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . B: Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . B: Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . B: So it's pretty squishy . B: That would that would serve that purpose . D: Spongy ? B: Um we could also use wood , or titanium . A: What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? B: Oh fya I don't have an information on that . B: However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . B: It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay . B: But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . B: Now let's first go through the list with the materials . B: So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . B: Can also mix these . B: Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . B: Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . B: Right ? B: Uh a dynamo . B: Interestingly enough . B: Um we could use solar cells . B: Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . B: Such as like watches you know . B: Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . B: So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . C: Mm . B: You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? B: Um solar cell is interesting . B: May fail though , every here and there . C: Would you have to leave it by the window ? B: Mm . C: yeah . B: Yeah . B: Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm . C: Yeah . B: Always the you But exactly . A: Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . D: Y probably not yeah . C: Yeah . B: Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . B: You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . B: So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . B: Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . B: We don't need that then . B: Um However our interface options are push-buttons . B: In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . B: Um However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . B: And they are possible . B: We have an okay for scroll wheels . B: Okay . B: Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . B: This however may exclude certain um materials . B: If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . B: Hence we might not be able to put it in there . B: So um There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . B: If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . B: I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . B: I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . B: So that's for the for the scroll wheel . B: Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . B: Let's see now . B: Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . B: But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? D: Mm . B: Or is anybody still alright . C: Yeah . D: No . D: Hmm . B: Alright . C: Yeah . B: Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . B: Um Um With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . B: We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . B: Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . C: Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . D: Mm . D: Like a covering . D: Yeah . C: So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . C: But then where do people hold it ? C: Just all be sort of spongy . A: Yeah . D: The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . C: So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? C: Like the iPod ? B: You can have an L_C_D_ screen . B: Um but therefore no rubber will be used . C: Right . B: Alright ? B: So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . B: With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . B: Um latex is tricky . B: Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . B: So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . C: Yeah . B: Or wood even . B: Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . B: Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . C: Yeah . B: Or make it just push-buttons . B: Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . B: Maybe not the nicest feel . B: Or not much originality really . A: So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? A: Or the rubbery we cannot ? B: With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . A: Kay . A: Mm . D: Mm . A: Mm . B: That's the tricky thing . C: Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . C: So that's thing if we did it yellow . A: Yeah . C: And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . C: They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . C: They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . A: Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? B: S Certainly can be done yes . B: Um yeah . B: if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . C: Yeah . B: Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . B: I assume . B: Yeah . B: So The fruit design um How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? B: Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . D: Mm . B: You name it . C: Mm . A: What about a smell ? B: Just design-wise . A: T to the remote ? B: Mm . B: Nice one . C: You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . C: In different ye yellows . D: Bright citrus colours yeah . B: Mm . C: I don't suppose we have to stick to co Stick to the colours yeah . B: Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . D: Oh yeah . D: Yellow and grey . A: Yellow and grey . B: So what have we , lemon , banana , is Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . C: Mm grapefruit . A: Grapefruit . B: But mm . A: I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . C: Yeah . A: Um Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . D: I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , like Well we kinda do yeah . C: Yeah . B: Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . C: Yeah . B: So Right . C: Yeah . D: And if it's yellow ? C: and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . A: It's it's yellow . B: I it's yellow . A: It's curved . D: Grey buttons yeah . B: Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? A: It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . C: Yeah . A: We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . C: On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . A: It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . D: Mm . C: Yeah . B: There you go . A: Rather than rather th Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . C: It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . D: Oh . D: Nice . D: Could look like a fruit bowl . B: It could be an ape . A: Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . C: Yeah . A: Hey we could have a variety of options here . C: Yeah . D: Kay . B: Yeah . A: Do you have more to your presentation ? B: That's pretty much it . B: I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . A: Oh . A: Okay . A: I'm gonna plug in here real quick . B: Sure . A: If I could . B: Hang on . B: There you go . A: Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . A: Um ow . A: Ow . D: So is the two piece idea out ? D: Or have we not decided ? C: Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . C: And the base station might not be necessary . D: Oh right okay . B: Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Mm . B: We can still do that . B: However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . A: Mm-hmm . B: So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . B: Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . D: Mm . B: You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . D: Mm . B: But could be done , of course . A: Okay . A: Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . A: Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . A: Probably case um material . A: And probably a shape also . A: Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . A: And what kind of supplements we'll have . A: Um Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . B: Right . A: And we have five minutes . B: Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . B: Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one . D: Mm . B: Right ? A: Kay . A: So Um I guess we should pick the case then . A: If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . A: We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . B: Yeah . A: But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? D: Well what about what you said , like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic ? C: Just just maybe yeah . C: Just a little bit of . A: Okay . A: So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? B: as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . A: Kay . A: So I guess the case would be plastic , with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . A: It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: M more of a l lamination perhaps . C: Yeah . D: So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? C: Yeah I think so . D: Yeah ? D: Okay . A: Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? B: Yes . B: It does . A: Kay . A: So I guess that , is that , is that about it ? A: So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? B: Right . A: Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . A: Um Here's what's gonna be going on . A: Um Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . A: Um Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . B: Right . A: Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . A: And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype . A: Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . A: So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . A: Alright . A: Okay . A: Let's do it .","summary":"The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel, are technologically innovative, easy to use, include a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy in feel. The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized, and is not rectangular. The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote, an iPod, and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components, energy sources, and materials. The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. The team then discussed and decided what components, materials, and energy sources to use. The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. The industrial designer will work on the look and feel design. The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation. The user interface designer and industrial designer will work on a prototype The remote will use conventional batteries. The case will be made of plastic with rubber grips. The remote will feature a scroll function similar to the scroll function found on iPods. The remote will use a more expensive, advanced chip-on-print. How to have a curved remote made with rubber. How to include a fruit and vegetable theme. What sort of chip to use. Whether to use plastic or rubber.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the conceptual design meeting, the team gathered to discuss the creation of a top-notch remote control. Led by the facilitator, they reviewed previous minutes outlining the goal of producing the finest remote control, incorporating company colors and logo. Insights from the Marketing Expert highlighted user preferences for simplicity, a locator feature, and a unique design. The User Interface Designer emphasized the need for a user-friendly interface, favoring a simple design over complexity. The Industrial Designer detailed the technical aspects, including the energy source options like batteries or solar cells. The team debated materials, with plastic being the versatile choice, while titanium posed cost challenges. Decision-wise, they opted for batteries as the energy source and a plastic case with a rubbery feel for grip. They agreed on a scroll wheel interface, necessitating a more advanced chip-on-print. Action items were assigned: Ryan to work on the user interface, Manuel on the look-and-feel design, and Corrine on product evaluation, aiming to create a prototype aligning with the design and interface concepts. The meeting concluded with plans for a follow-up session in thirty minutes to progress with the prototype development, aligning with a target revenue of \u20ac50 million for the innovative remote control.","relevance":0.5453889966,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the preferred energy source chosen for the remote control?","answer":"Batteries"},{"question":"What material was selected for the case of the remote control?","answer":"Plastic with a rubbery feel for grip"},{"question":"What type of interface design did the team decide on for the remote control?","answer":"Scroll wheel interface, similar to an iPod"},{"question":"Who was assigned to work on the user interface design for the remote control?","answer":"Ryan"}]}
{"meeting_id":"ES2016d","dialogue":"A: Yep . A: Soon as I get this . A: Okay . A: This is our last meeting . A: Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . A: Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . A: Um then we will um do an evaluation . A: Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . A: Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . A: Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . A: Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . A: Um we looked at uh the the trends . A: We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . A: It was twice as important as anything else . A: Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . A: Um and a spongy feel . A: So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . A: Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . A: Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . A: Um looking at other other devices . A: Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . A: Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . A: Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . A: Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . A: But I think we've still decided not to go with that . A: Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . A: Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . A: So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . C: The prototype discussion . A: The prototype yeah . A: Do you need a this ? C: No . A: Okay . C: There is our remo the banana . B: Can try to plug that in there but Right . C: Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . C: Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . C: Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . C: These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . C: So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . C: Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . C: You have to use your imagination a little bit . C: And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . A: Very nice . C: And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . C: Volume up and down . C: And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . C: It's that that simple . C: That just represents the infrared uh beam . C: That's a simple on and off switch . C: Um I don't know , we could use the voice . C: T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . C: And um that's about it . C: It's as simple as you , we could make it really . C: Is there anything you want to add ? B: That's what we have there . B: That's plastic . B: Plastic covered with rubber . B: We might uh add some more underneath here . B: Maybe give it , give it a form . B: I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . C: Yeah . C: Doesn't make much make much difference . A: Mm-hmm . C: You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . B: Exactly , use both . B: Might as well think about Th think about the button as well . C: T the actual thing might be smaller . C: Yeah . B: Like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all . A: What but what's that button ? C: Just the on and off . B: It's a quick on-off button . A: Uh , 'kay . B: That's um yeah I think it's pretty important . B: So you don't have to fiddle with that . A: Kay . B: Right ? B: Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . C: Yeah . B: You wanna play with that over there . B: There you go . C: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . A: Would you like to uh Well done . B: Right . D: Pretty impressive . D: Kind of a banana . C: With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . A: Well luckily we are going to find out . A: Or not luckily . A: Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . D: I do . D: Okay . D: You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . D: Um . D: Okay . D: So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . D: Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . D: And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . D: And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . D: Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . D: So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . D: And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . D: With seven being false , we did not achieve that . D: Okay . D: So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? A: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . D: Mm . C: Yeah . A: So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . C: I would . A: It's bright . C: It's bright . C: It's It's curved . A: It still has your traditional black . C: It's not there's no sharp angles to it . A: Yep , not angular . D: Mm . B: I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . B: However the colour , we don't have a say in that . D: Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . C: Some people might say it . B: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . C: Yeah . A: Mm . B: So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . D: That's true . A: Yep . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: S nothing you can say about that . B: I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . C: Yeah . B: But Right . A: Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . B: Right . B: It's different . B: You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . D: Um okay so , do you think , since we This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? D: Does that sound good ? B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: What do you think ? D: Three ? D: Four ? A: I would say four . D: Five ? D: Four is fair . B: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Very non-committal , four . D: Okay , the second one . D: Did we make it simple for new users ? B: It's very intuitive , I think yeah . C: Yeah . C: I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . B: S give it a one . D: One , 'kay . A: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? C: Uh yeah . D: I'd say that So one ? C: Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . B: Right . A: Mm-hmm . C: And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . A: S scrolling through and selecting a few . C: Yeah . B: Right . B: So that's a one . D: Yeah ? A: I think that's a one . D: Okay . D: Okay um the fourth one . D: How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? D: One of the number one complaints . B: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . C: Yeah . D: Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . C: It's bright yellow . C: Bright yellow's hard to lose . C: But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . C: That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . C: That was what we'd we'd mentioned . A: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could And it is quite bright and Uh Yeah . C: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . C: But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . B: Oops . C: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . B: Hmm . C: That's gonna be a difficult shape to Yeah . B: Well what S Mm . C: Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? D: Okay . C: I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . C: You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . D: That's true . A: But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . D: Mm . B: Oh yeah . C: Yeah . B: You probably Mm . A: Probably two . A: You know . A: If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then I'd say two . C: Yeah . A: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . C: Yeah . B: Y you could add an extra feature actually . B: Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . C: Yeah . B: We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . A: Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a Some sort of proximity Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . B: Yes . C: Yeah true . C: But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . D: Annoying alarm or something ? D: Yeah . B: It's it's Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . C: They're cheap . C: So it can't be that expensive . C: Yeah . B: That can't cost much . C: Yeah . B: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other Right . C: stick it on the T_V_ . B: That'd be tough then . B: Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . B: Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . C: Yeah . D: So . D: Are we adding one of these two features ? B: Let's add one of those features and say yes . D: gonna say okay . A: Okay . D: So we're back to a one ? D: Or a two ? C: Two . B: Two . D: Two , 'kay . A: Two . D: Okay . D: Are we technologically innovative ? B: Uh It's all just It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right . C: I'd say so . C: Uh don't get many mo remote controls with screens on . C: Yeah it's stolen technology . D: From iPod yeah . A: It's But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . C: But we have . D: But for remotes yeah . A: Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour . C: Fa 'cause it's stolen . D: Two ? D: Three ? A: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . C: No maybe not . B: Yeah not really . D: But how many remotes do you see like this ? D: Not so many . A: If we added the screaming factor then we go up . B: Right . A: Um I would say we're probably at four . D: Really ? D: Okay . D: That's gonna hurt us . D: Okay . D: Um spongy material ? B: Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . A: We have some spongy , yeah . C: Yeah as much as as needed , I think . D: Kay . B: It's not a one though . A: No . B: One would be the whole thing to fold and stuff . A: Yeah . A: Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: So that's a four at most . A: Probably a four at most . D: And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? A: Possibly even a five . B: Y yes . D: I'd say we did . C: Yeah . A: If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . B: More Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is . C: Yeah . C: On the Yeah . A: It's true . C: Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . D: Kay . D: Alright . D: Now we just gotta calculate . D: Six eight twelve sixteen . D: Seventeen divided by s Eight . A: Seven is Two point two point four ? C: Is that some long division ? C: No . D: Well I haven't done math in years . A: Something . D: What two I dunno . C: Just , I'm sure there's a . D: Okay we'll say two point four two . D: Right ? D: How does that look ? B: I'm impressed . B: I can't do that without a calculator . C: No I can't do long very impressive . D: It's been a while . A: And what what is the acceptable criteria ? A: Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? D: Oh no . D: They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . A: Alright then . D: So that's that . A: Okay . A: Well , let's see . A: Now we get to do the budget numbers . A: You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . A: But we do . A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah so . C: You'd been going a long time dividing that . C: It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . D: Oh my god . D: Okay . C: Two point four two basically . D: Yeah we'll go with that . D: Not too shabby . A: So I have here an Yeah . B: Fifty percent , you're kidding . B: P It's too much . A: We want a fifty percent profit on this . A: Oh you can't really see that very well . C: Charge about three hundred quid for it . A: Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . A: Okay , so Well let's see . B: Um Uh Battery . A: The f the Wonder if I can make this What the Oh it won't let me do that . A: Okay . A: Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . A: I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . A: There's uh four , five , six categories . A: We have energy source , electronics , case . A: Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . A: Okay so Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . A: Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? A: Probably some e either two or four . B: Two . A: Two ? A: Like it . B: At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . B: People can change it every month . B: They won't know until after they bought it . A: Excellent . A: This is consumerism . A: Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . C: We're advanced chip are we ? B: That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . A: Kay , we have one of those . A: Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved . B: Double curved , yes . A: Case materials are plastic . B: Plastic . A: Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . B: N no . A: Is that right or is it just one ? B: No that's just one . A: Maybe it's one because of the 'Kay . B: It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . C: Yeah yeah . D: Right . A: I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . B: Exactly , right . D: Oh . A: Special colour ? B: That's not a special colour . D: Bright yellow . B: It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . A: Interface type . A: We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . C: S That's Yeah . B: S Yes unfortunately . A: So we actually have the L_C_D_ display and then is it the integrated or is it Yeah . C: And then I'd say the integrated . A: Kay . A: Button supplement ? A: Special colour ? C: Mm . A: Um special form ? A: Special material . B: We could of course make the buttons wood . B: Say mahogany or so Mm-hmm or titanium . D: It'd look really lovely . A: Or titanium . D: Yeah . A: They cost us all the same . C: remote control . B: Uh just Yeah that's too much . A: Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . C: No that's getting a bit tiny . A: Um Okay . C: Yeah . C: I'd ignore that . D: Leave it blank . A: We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . A: So our total is fifteen point five . A: Which I believe is by three Euros over . B: It's hard to believe . B: So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? A: So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . C: If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . C: And just had a scroll wheel interface . C: And the L_C_D_ display . C: I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . A: Yeah 'cause the Well 'cause we have to have both right ? C: Yeah . B: I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . C: Yeah . B: You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . A: Mm-hmm . B: So s yeah let's take away the Yeah . C: Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . B: Yeah . B: Right . A: So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? C: Uh that is possible yeah . B: Right . B: We may not need it . B: There you go . A: Well there we go . B: Perfect . C: There we go . A: Twelve point five . D: Perfect . A: Okay . A: So we just remove our screen here . C: Screen . C: Make it a bigger dial . C: Easier to use . C: Even easier to use then . A: Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . B: Okay , the So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . A: Back to the design room boys . D: What's the blue part ? B: central ? C: That was just we ran out of yellow . D: Oh that's the batteries . B: Oh that's just yeah . D: Okay . B: There you go . C: There you go . B: Oops . C: Even simpler . D: Looks more like a banana . C: Yeah . C: For all those fruit lovers out there . B: There you go . B: One more criteria . A: Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . A: Was no . A: We redesigned it . C: Yeah . A: Now it's yes . A: Next slide . A: Project evaluation . A: Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . A: Um So I guess that Let's see here . A: I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . A: But I'd like to hear your thoughts . D: Trying to fill in some time there . B: Fair enough . A: Uh h what did you think of our project process ? C: I think we did yeah I think we did quite well . B: Great . B: Yeah . C: Um Yeah . A: Good . D: Good teamwork . B: Just half a day , you have a remote . B: There you go . C: Right from the start of the day . A: Yeah I think we st we started off a little little weak . C: We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . A: Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . A: Um um But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . A: Um room for creativity ? A: There was that . A: Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . A: Um you guys worked together well as a team . A: And um the means ? A: Which was the whiteboard and the pens . C: Yeah . C: We've used the whiteboard . B: Super super . A: I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p Well Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired . D: Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . B: Well that's not my fault . B: That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know Heads are gonna roll , believe me . D: No I know . D: I'm yeah . D: Incom Mm . B: Yes yes . A: Okay . A: N new ideas found ? A: Um Yes for the remote . D: Kinda . A: Maybe no not f for technology . C: Technology used . A: Alright . A: Closing . A: Costs are within the budget . A: Project is evaluated . A: Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . A: That's it . C: Excellent . A: And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . A: Actually . A: Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . D: We might have a while though . A: And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . A: But that's the end of our meeting .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana. The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. The team found that, although the overall design of the prototype was attractive, its yellow color was ugly. The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them. *NA* The remote will make some sort of noise based on its proximity to a television. The remote will use two batteries. The remote will use an advanced chip-on-print. The remote will be double curved. The remote case will be made of plastic. The remote will come in a special color. The remote will not use an LCD. What feature to include to prevent the remote from getting lost. What sort of button supplements the remote requires. How to meet the project budget.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize their project, the team, consisting of A, C, B, and D, embarked on a comprehensive meeting. A led the discussion, starting with a review of the previous meeting's minutes, highlighting key trends like the preference for a fancy look-and-feel, spongy textures, and limited buttons. They delved into the prototype presentation, where C showcased a banana-shaped remote design with a scroll wheel for controls and a screen for navigation. The team debated incorporating speech recognition but ultimately decided against it. Moving on to evaluation criteria, D presented a detailed assessment, leading to decisions on simplicity, user behavior alignment, and the prevention of remote loss. They settled on a technologically innovative approach, considering a proximity alarm feature. The budget discussion revealed a target revenue of \u20ac12.50 per unit, prompting adjustments to the prototype to meet cost constraints. A lively debate ensued on the need for an LCD display and special button materials. The meeting concluded with a project evaluation, highlighting teamwork, creativity, and leadership improvements throughout the process. Action items included completing a final questionnaire and meeting summary, with potential follow-ups pending approval from higher management. The team left the meeting with a sense of accomplishment and readiness for the next steps in their project journey.","relevance":0.5341919661,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were some key trends discussed in the meeting?","answer":"Preference for a fancy look-and-feel, spongy textures, limited buttons."},{"question":"What was the design of the prototype presented by team member C?","answer":"Banana-shaped remote with a scroll wheel for controls and a screen for navigation."},{"question":"What was the team's decision regarding incorporating speech recognition into the prototype?","answer":"They decided against incorporating speech recognition."},{"question":"What was the target revenue per unit discussed in the budget section of the meeting?","answer":"\u20ac12.50 per unit."}]}

B: People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . B: So it needs to be trendy . B: I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . B: But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . B: So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . B: Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . B: And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . B: Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . B: In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board . C: Whitebo Yeah , you can start it you know . A: Mm-hmm . B: And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . B: I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so Um Yes . D: Under documents in the shared folder . D: Okay . B: Do Do we have to say something about that ? B: I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . D: Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . D: And uh , yeah . B: Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . D: Yes . B: Um . B: Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . B: So , we'll come to that later . B: So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . B: So , I would suggest uh Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . D: Each of us is going . B: I I'm not really sure how this works , but Yes , a good idea Mael . D: Okay , shall I start ? A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . D: So , i But it's Actually , I think I cannot go with uh Yeah . C: No they will record through that . C: There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . B: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Kay . B: You you D doesn't it work ? B: Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . A: Mm-hmm . B: Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . A: I have to draw . B: So um L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . A: M my my favourite animal . A: Sorry this is all tangled up here . B: Oh , I see uh Yeah . A: That's better . C: Yeah . B: Yes . B: Mm . B: So draw it . B: We will try to guess what it is . A: Mm-hmm . A: I'm a very bad drawer . A: Weird . A: Um . A: You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . A: I'm a bad drawer . A: Okay . B: Mm . A: They're ears , by the way . C: s a cat . A: No . A: Um close though . A: Okay so like a pet animal . D: Okay . A: Like a cat . C: Yeah . B: It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . A: No , not a cat though . B: What is this now ? C: Ah you forget about it . D: You're on the knife . C: Yeah , uh I think it's fine . C: I just don't want to carry it off . C: Man , this wires , eh ? C: We need a wireless microphone . C: You know ? C: Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . B: So , that's the cat . A: Okay . A: So . A: It's not a cat , it's a dog . B: Oh . C: So . D: Mael . B: It's a dog . A: Yes . B: So but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ? C: Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ? A: It's got a tail then . B: B bo both predators . C: Yeah , sure , yeah . A: Yeah yeah . C: I thought so . C: The dogs have a tail . B: So , thank you . A: So do cats . B: Uh d did you uh work out cord ? A: And you guessed cats without a tail . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , I think I will go without without it , right ? A: Okay . B: Okay . C: It'll still not extend , right ? C: It's not up to that . A: Okay , there you go . A: So what favourite characteristics . A: Uh . A: Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A: A horse ? C: It's a horse . A: This is why you're the designer . A: And I'm marketing . B: Yes . B: Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . B: Yes . B: Oh very good . B: So I suppose it Yes . A: Ah Mm-hmm . C: Ah I think you can put that . A: That's it . A: A blue and black zebra . B: Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . B: Yes . B: Very good . B: So Ma Matthew ? A: The very rare blue zebras . A: Yes . C: I'll tell to get it off my Uh ? C: Mm-hmm . B: So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . A: You got a lot of room here . A: You can probably reach . C: Oh y it's not for that . A: No ? C: No . C: Okay . C: Yeah . C: So what should I draw ? C: Mm . C: He has already to do cat . A: I took a dog . A: Um . A: A mouse ? B: This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . A: Okay . D: Yeah . D: And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Yes , the moustache . D: So Uh yeah . B: That's that's definitely a cat . A: Mm-hmm . D: And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . D: Yeah . B: It's quite , you know relaxed situation . B: Yes . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yes , okay . D: She has the small legs . B: Th thank you , Matthew . D: Yeah . D: Thank you , Matthew . A: It's a very big rat . D: Perfect . A: Or a very small cat . D: Oh a rat , okay . B: Yes , this is certain uh some contribution to our project . D: And you , A bird . A: Mm 'kay . A: Your turn . B: So . B: Let's see . B: Which animal has not been drawn yet . B: So you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water . D: Okay , in the water . A: Ah I don't know what that is . A: It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess . D: Mm . D: Yeah . B: Mm . C: So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? D: Put it colours . D: Maybe it would help us . A: Yeah . B: Yes . D: With different pen widths . A: Mm-hmm Oh , it's a shark now . B: So Oh , yes , why not ? D: Ah it's a shark , yeah . B: Good idea . C: Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? A: Mm . D: Oh . A: Now it's a swordfish . B: Why not . D: You have some in in Australia , right ? B: A swordfish . A: Swordfish . D: Yeah . A: Um , maybe . D: I dunno . A: I've never seen one , no . D: Oh well . D: Yeah . B: I hope it still works . D: Perfect . B: So W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . D: So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But uh Yeah , exactly , yeah . C: You should go for the next one it seems to me . A: Mm-hmm . B: Let's continue to uh to the real stuff . D: Wow . B: Um our project uh finance uh thing . B: Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product . C: Twenty four . D: Yeah . D: Per remote control , yeah ? A: Mm . D: Per project . B: Yes . B: Okay . B: Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . B: So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . B: Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , maybe some uh Asian countries . C: Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . B: Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . D: So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . B: Yes , of course . B: Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? D: Of course . C: They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . A: Mm . B: You all have to be paid . A: Mm . B: Excuse me ? D: Oh you're g very good in mathematics . C: Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button . A: Yes . B: Yes , indeed . D: Four million . B: So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . D: Yeah . B: So , that about finance . B: And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . B: Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . A: Mm . A: Yeah . C: Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . A: Mm . C: You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set . B: We wer we were thinking television . B: Uh . A: Mm . C: So , you need to record the channels . A: Mm . A: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , Uh And Uh , and Marketing . B: Yes , yes . A: Mm . B: Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . A: Mm . A: Mm . D: And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? D: Or th So you are the marketing . A: I'm marketing . A: Yep . D: And you are in the u use user interface uh design . C: Yeah . B: Yes . D: So just yeah I wanted to to be sure . C: Yeah . C: Sure . D: And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yes . D: Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . C: Oh . C: I'm Matthew . D: Okay . C: You know . D: Mael . C: Matth s uh Anna . D: Happy to meet you . A: Anna . D: Okay . D: It's very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face . C: And um uh Matthew , yeah . B: A and I'm Nanne . C: I thi think you know me , yeah ? B: So Yes . C: right yeah . B: So . B: Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well , to specify in this first phase of of the project . C: So . D: So mm So I Like what ? A: Mm . C: So And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . B: So the browse function , as you m mentioned . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Oth yeah . B: Yes . B: Yeah . C: Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so Yeah I_P_O_ or . B: Yes . A: Mm . D: Like internet on the on T_V_ ? A: Mm . C: Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . C: For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . D: Yeah . A: Mm . A: But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . C: Yeah . C: Ah it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . C: The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . B: Mm , well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . D: Actually , yeah w Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . C: Let's Let's take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . A: Mm . A: Yeah . D: Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Yeah . D: But before Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . A: But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . B: Mm mm mm . B: Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . B: So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: No , it's okay , yeah I understand . D: Mm . C: So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um Yeah . D: Yeah . D: The Yeah , the main is browsing . B: Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . D: Yeah . B: I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . C: Yeah . B: Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . C: Okay . B: So So you know now the basic the basic things . C: Okay , we are alread mm . D: Okay . C: Mm . C: Yeah . B: And well just just for the next meeting , um well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . C: L Yeah , sure . D: Mm-hmm . B: So Um you will be working on on technical function design , so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface . C: Stam . A: Yeah . B: So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Okay . B: So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . D: Perfect . B: K keep it in mind .","summary":"The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. He starts talking about the product they are to design, a remote control which should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The general outline of the project will be the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard, and each person draws his\/her favorite animal on it. The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance, which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. This includes the basics such as on\/off, channel up\/down browsing, volume and record button(s). At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder, but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he\/she will be working on. The interface designer will work on a general design. The industrial designer will work on the technica function design. The marketing expert will think about user requirements. The selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros each. The production cost will be twelve Euros and fifty cents. The profit will be about fifty million Euro. -The remote will target an international market. The remote will be for use with the television set. The necessary buttons are on\/off, channel up\/down browsing, volume, and record button(s). They have not decided what functions the remote can have, but they have discussed that they may not be able to produce something extremely fancy with the given budget. They will need to examine user requirements before deciding on what functionalities are necessary.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the project, the team gathered for a meeting led by Nanne, with participants including Anna from marketing, Matthew in user interface design, and Mael as the industrial designer. The meeting aimed to outline the project plan for designing a new remote control, emphasizing originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness. Nanne stressed the importance of keeping the selling price at \u20ac25, targeting a revenue of \u20ac50 million, and ensuring production costs stay below \u20ac12.50 per unit. Discussions revolved around the essential functionalities of the remote control, such as volume control, channel browsing, and potential future features like TV over IP. Action items included further design work focusing on technical function design and considering user requirements for the next meeting. Demonstrations on a whiteboard added a fun element to the meeting, showcasing the team's creativity. Despite some technical hiccups, the team successfully engaged in the exercise. The meeting concluded with plans for the next steps and a follow-up meeting in thirty minutes to continue the project's momentum.","relevance":0.3049074709,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"Who led the meeting to kick off the project?","answer":"Nanne"},{"question":"What was the target selling price set for the new remote control?","answer":"\u20ac25"},{"question":"Which team member was responsible for user interface design?","answer":"Matthew"},{"question":"What was the revenue target set for the project?","answer":"\u20ac50 million"}]}
{"meeting_id":"IS1000b","dialogue":"C: Okay . B: So I see all everybody's here , 'kay . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yep . B: And we can start meeting . C: Okay . A: What's the agenda for this meeting ? B: The I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you . A: Okay . B: Um as you can see here . D: Perfect . B: So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . A: Mm-hmm . B: I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Um . A: Mm-hmm . C: Next . D: So y you are the secretary also . B: Yes . D: Right ? D: Okay . B: Indeed . B: Um . B: Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . D: Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . B: Um . B: W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them . B: Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . B: Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . A: Mm-hmm . B: Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , the customers , indeed yes . A: Mm . D: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? A: Mm . D: Oh the customers , okay . A: Yeah . B: Think that's that's important matter . A: That's the big question yeah . B: Uh . B: So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . B: Good . B: Um . B: Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? A: No , I don't . B: You don't have presentation ? A: I wasn't . A: No . B: Uh you want a table to to uh Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . A: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . A: Mm-hmm . A: Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . A: Um . A: It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . A: Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . A: Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um . A: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . A: Um . A: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . A: Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . A: Uh . A: Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . B: Mm . A: Um . B: Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ? A: I have an a web page yes . B: Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . A: Yep . A: Yep , sure . B: Uh about this . A: Mm-hmm . A: So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . A: Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . A: Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . B: Mm . A: Um . A: Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . B: Mm . A: Um . A: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . B: Yes yes , I have that too . A: Um . A: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . B: Mm . A: Um . D: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's Okay too much time to learn . A: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . A: Yep . D: Okay . A: Um . D: Not enough Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file okay . A: And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . A: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . C: What do you mean there ? A: For R_S_I_ ? A: Respet Repetitive strain injury . C: Okay . B: Mm . A: So . A: But Mm . B: They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? B: But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ? A: Yeah . A: That's what the report says yeah . B: So mm . A: Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . C: You can disconnect it there no ? B: You can maybe just just Hmm . A: Oh no , yeah . A: Yeah . D: O otherwise you yeah . A: Um , s hang on . C: Then you can connect this one or this one yeah . D: You can connect this one . C: All to your computer . D: Yeah . A: Well . D: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um Yeah Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . C: Oh yeah . A: Oh I need to muck around with this . A: It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . A: It's just a web link . C: Okay . C: Hmm . C: Yeah . A: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . D: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . A: Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . D: Speech recognition in Ah okay . A: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . B: D do you have numbers o o on that ? A: Yes , I'll just get this up . D: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech . A: Well potentially yeah , um I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well . D: Okay . D: Interesting idea . A: You wanna have both options . D: Okay . B: Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Yeah . B: But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . C: Well it would be f No you can't . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? C: Oh . C: Well , it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , yeah . B: Mm . D: But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting . A: Mm . A: Yeah . C: It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi Okay it's uh decline . B: Yes , that that that that's mm . B: Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation ? D: Okay . A: Um Well This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . D: So you had to to to summarise maybe the Mm . A: Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . B: Mm . C: Okay . A: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: But we sh Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , which we'll be talking about later I think . B: Decline with age , mm . B: Mm . B: Yes . B: We will talk about it later . A: Did you get the email ? B: Okay . A: Yep , that one . D: Mm-hmm . A: Just follow that link . D: I thi You us yeah yeah . A: It'll be in a different window , yep . A: That's left that one . A: Yep . D: Okay perfect . D: .. . A: Mm . A: So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . C: Okay . A: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that . B: Mm . D: Mm 'kay . B: Okay . B: um Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ? D: Yeah . D: Mm I okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair ? B: Oh , this is Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . C: Now you can move I think yeah . D: I okay . B: Yes . B: You can you can sa take my chair . C: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the . A: Sorry ? A: Oh . C: Yeah . D: So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . D: And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . D: Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . A: Mm . D: So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . A: Mm-hmm . D: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . A: Mm-hmm . D: So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . D: I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . A: Mm-hmm . D: So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . D: Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right . A: Mm . D: So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . D: This is very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that . B: Mm-hmm . D: And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know . A: Well . B: Uh-huh . A: You drew it a long time ago ? B: Is huh overwhelming . D: And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . A: Ninety one . B: No . B: And and why do you want these kind of component ? D: So . B: I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? B: What were your Mm . D: So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh Yeah . B: Yes . B: It it it's more clear now I think . B: So Mm-hmm . C: But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies . B: What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ? B: Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . D: Of course yeah . B: So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . B: I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . D: Yeah . D: We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yes . B: Okay . D: Um . D: Okay . B: Thank you . D: The frequencies ? D: Yeah yeah . C: Yeah . D: Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah . C: But you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . D: That can control o other things . D: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Ah . C: So maybe we should think of yeah . D: Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh Yes . B: Yeah yes I I I I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . A: That's handy . A: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . C: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . A: Yeah . A: I like that idea . B: Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . C: Yeah so . B: I I I assume you were finished here . B: Uh okay . C: Okay . C: So I can take I think mine now there . D: Okay . C: Okay so voila . C: Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . C: Okay . B: Oh . B: I Uh , sorry ? B: I know where it is . C: It's on the desktop . B: It's uh Yes . C: Technical function . C: Okay . B: It's uh Mm-hmm . C: Like so . C: Well . C: So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . C: So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . D: Mm-hmm . C: So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . C: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . B: Mm . D: Yep . C: And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . C: And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . C: Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch . C: And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . A: Mm-hmm . C: And then whi which is generally used by the people . C: And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with Yeah . A: Okay . A: How would that work ? A: So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? C: Yeah . A: or does it know which one you want to use ? C: Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Mm . C: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . A: Mm . B: Mm mm mm mm mm . A: Mm . D: These are kind of next generation functionalities . C: It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . B: Mm yes , but I think it's i i it's already there , I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop . A: Mm . C: It's goi Yeah it's Yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm 'kay . C: So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: That's fair enough . A: Mm . A: But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . C: No no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me . A: That's , yeah . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Because y Mm-hmm . B: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . B: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Yep . C: Yeah . C: So Okay so that p ends my presentation . B: But it's good to keep in mind . A: Mm . B: Mm . B: Very well . C: Well . C: So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . C: And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . D: Yeah . A: Mm . C: And thi this is going to come . B: Good . D: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . C: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and Yeah so . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Mm . B: Um , so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Um first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: That's that's especially because of the internet of course . A: Hmm . B: So we should think about it um . B: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . A: Mm . B: Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . A: Mm . C: Um . B: Um further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? B: Uh indeed indeed . A: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? A: Mm . B: And and and the hard disk recorders . B: Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Fourteen or for O okay . D: So Mm-hmm . B: So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . A: Mm-hmm . B: Um therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . B: Hmm . A: Mm . C: Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh Yeah so . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Mm . B: Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh Hmm . A: Mm . A: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , that's , yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . D: Yeah . B: Yes yes mo Yes it's recognisable Mm mm . D: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . D: Yeah . A: That's Mm . B: And and they are skilled uh by using it . C: So for example uh Well uh Okay , it works . D: Mm-hmm . D: .. . C: Fine . C: So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Forty minutes ? B: Mael can you hand me over this uh ? D: Yes . B: Uh thank you . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? B: Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm . A: Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue . C: Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . C: too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: Okay . B: Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . D: Yep . A: Mm . B: Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . A: Yeah . A: Which I think is quite tricky . C: Yeah . A: Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? B: Of course they have already one . B: So our our our remote control has to be better . A: But it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . B: Mm . B: I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but Indeed . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: But why are they buying one in the first place ? B: So that will be about functionality Mm . A: Mm . A: But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . A: I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . A: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . B: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance What do What do you think about What componen I don't know . A: Well , we can't , with the price range . A: We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product . D: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . A: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: Yeah . D: And um But yeah that's Ye I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . A: But yeah . A: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot . B: I don't know whether that's necessary . B: Is the L_C_D_ screen I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . A: For universal remotes If you mm . A: And quite complicated to use , yes . B: S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . A: Mm-hmm . A: Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s yeah . D: Yeah . D: Universal . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . B: Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . A: Okay . A: So they're yeah . B: People yes . B: Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . A: I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . A: Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? A: I don't know . B: Uh well I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . D: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: So d Do you agree ? C: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . D: Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . C: Uh and it d uh Our provin Mm . A: Mm . D: So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah . B: Mm-hmm . B: You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ? D: Yeah . B: Okay . B: Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . C: Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Okay . C: Uh that's needed right now . C: And uh basically you can look to the standards of other Actu Yeah . D: Yeah that's needed , yeah . A: Mm . D: And if we want to get the market , we really need that . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . D: Yes . D: Exactly . A: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . B: Yes . C: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . D: Is that okay for you ? D: Yeah . B: Mm mm mm mm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . D: Yes . A: Mm . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: Mm-hmm yep . C: Voila . C: Hmm . B: So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no . C: So . C: Well . C: Oh I don't have anything right now . C: We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the Yeah so we meet in well what are our Okay . D: Oh that's that's fine then . B: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: W yes , we uh we can have lunch now . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: So um Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . B: But you will be informed via the computer . B: Okay . C: Cool . D: Okay perfect . C: So see you later .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. The marketing expert explains the research she read about, which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. The Industrial Designer presents, explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. The Interface Designer gives his presentation, talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. Standard TV remotes have an on\/off button, play, volume change, number keypad, and a 1 or 2 digit option. He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. The project manager recieves a message from account manager, which he shares with the group. They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo, VCR, and TV. They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. The industrial designer will try to find out which components are needed. The interface designer will get more specific user interface content. The marketing expert will look at what trends are in this type of market They will target the 20-40 age group. Teletext is a well known feature of televisions but is no longer in frequent use because of the internet, will not be used. The remote should be trendy as possible but still have a reliable image so that it does not appear poorly-functional. The group is interested in creating a universal remote, however they are unable to deterine what components are needed without looking at the standards and current trends in the market. One group member brought up that it is not possible to make a universal high-performance remote with the given budget. More research is necessary to determine this.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, participants gathered to discuss the design and functionality of a new remote control. The team included B, the meeting facilitator, A who presented research on user habits, D the Industrial Designer showcasing the technical aspects, and C providing insights on user interaction.

B: Okay mm yes I have it . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . A: Um can I just put this on ? A: So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . A: Um . A: This is to do this I will not remove my microphone . A: We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . A: The most important by far was the look and feel of it . A: It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . A: It needs to stand out . A: It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . A: Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . A: People will wanna buy it . A: Um That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . A: People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . A: That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . A: Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . A: So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . A: Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . A: This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . B: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . A: Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . A: That would make it stand out . B: Hmm . A: Um . D: So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? B: Spongy feel ? D: Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo Okay . A: Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . C: You can Yeah . A: Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . B: Mm . D: Yeah . B: Okay . A: So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . A: So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . A: Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . A: That's one way of looking at it um . A: Textured feel we just talked about . A: Maybe it's another way of doing that . B: Mm-hmm . A: So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . A: So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . D: Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . D: Yeah . A: Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . A: Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . A: They're big selling items . A: People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . A: Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . A: Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . A: There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . D: Mm-hmm . A: I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in . A: And use . A: I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . B: Mm . B: Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the Mm . C: Voila . A: Yep and that's the presentation . B: Okay good , that's very clear . D: Yeah very clear . C: Yeah . B: Kay . B: Um . A: So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? B: Uh Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to Yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational Hmm . A: I think you Hmm . D: To let the people choose , you mean ? D: Yeah . A: Well we're selling so many units of this . A: This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . B: Yes . A: Mm mm . B: Mm-hmm . D: Sure that fits the Yeah . B: Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro . A: Mm . A: Mm . B: That's a very good idea um And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because the Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning . C: Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: Yeah yeah I agree . C: It should be easier with that . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm , yeah . D: Yeah . D: And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . C: So Yeah . C: Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . A: Mm-hmm . C: So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . C: Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to So it it it's like it limited one . A: That's a good idea . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Hmm . A: Mm . A: Yeah I really like that idea . D: So what functionalities do you suggest for that ? D: For facing this problem ? C: In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . A: Mm-hmm . C: Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . A: Mm . A: Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . C: Yeah some ten twelve channel information . C: You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . D: Okay . A: Mm . C: And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Oh yeah yeah yeah mm . A: Mm . D: Mm . A: Mm . C: You can't . C: And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . D: Mm-hmm . C: So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . C: I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . A: Mm-hmm . C: I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . A: Mm b But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm . D: Yeah . C: At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or Yeah you can let them to do that . D: And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? A: Two thirty five supposed to finish . D: Some of them ? D: And uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise . A: Hmm . C: N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . D: Yeah . A: Hmm . C: Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: I think you can do it both ways . C: So it de So So Yeah . A: You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . D: A standard . D: Yeah . B: Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . D: Yeah . B: I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real We have to consider it . A: Hmm . A: Hmm . A: Hmm . B: S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the Mm . D: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Hmm . D: Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or We Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . C: Yeah . C: We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah . A: Mm . C: Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . B: Mm mm . D: Yeah . C: And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . A: Hmm . B: Hmm . D: Yeah . C: If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . A: Mm . A: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . C: So No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ . B: Mm . A: I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Hmm . A: Mm . C: It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . D: Mm . A: Hmm . D: It's true . C: And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . A: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . C: You know . B: Kay good . C: Yeah so You you have time some more ? D: I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the Okay . B: Mm yes um I would Yes yes you can you can still . C: Yep . B: We have time . C: Sure you can you know . D: So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . A: Mm-hmm . D: So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . D: So there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . B: Nice . C: Hmm . D: Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . D: And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um . D: So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . D: And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . C: Yeah mm mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . D: If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or I dunno . A: Mm . B: Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . D: Yes . D: Yes . A: Mm-hmm . B: So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Yes . B: I mean just what Mm-hmm . A: Mm just have a yeah Just the veneer on it , yeah . D: Yeah like they do in with cars I think . D: Yeah inside the car yeah . D: So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . C: Yeah . D: And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . D: And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . A: Hmm . D: So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . D: And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . D: So to to sum up um we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . D: And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working uh . C: Sorry . A: Mm . B: Mm . D: So I I cannot design something without your agreement , right ? C: Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside W wh what W what Okay . B: No of course . D: Yes . D: Yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . D: I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . C: Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . D: Okay . C: How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . D: Yeah . B: So So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . D: Yeah good idea . D: Yeah . B: Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . D: Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah . B: Yes . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . D: Yes . C: D well Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . B: Do you think that's feasible ? B: Uh You th you think it's possible . C: Is it possible to fit in to that ? D: Yeah also thinking , I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , but uh . C: Sorry . B: Hmm . A: Well maybe we need specific costings then . A: Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . D: Yeah that's an excellent idea . B: Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . D: Yeah yeah . B: That w that would be a very good idea . A: Mm . D: Yeah because right now I don't have price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that . B: Mm . B: Good good . C: Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . D: Yeah . C: For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . D: Okay . D: I agree on that . A: Mm . D: Yeah . C: It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but Yeah . B: Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price . A: Hmm . C: Yeah it's uh Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for Yeah . B: Do do you agree ? D: Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that . A: Mm yeah sure . C: Yeah . B: Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . D: Yeah . C: Yea Okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: Uh so drawing it on the board . D: Perfect yeah . B: And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . B: So um Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . C: Yeah sure . C: Yeah we will uh Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Mm . B: Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . C: Uh . A: Mm . C: Yeah . B: But that that that that can be done later . D: Yeah customized . B: We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . A: Mm . B: Um . C: Okay . C: We can give them smooth keys , you know . C: Smooth keys with bigger s uh So that you know The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . D: Yeah . B: Mm . A: So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ? A: Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . A: Mm . C: At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . A: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm yeah . B: Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think . C: Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh Yeah . A: You see ? D: I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah . A: Yeah . B: No no . A: Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . B: Mm mm mm . B: Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . C: Yeah . A: Mm . B: So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . D: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Um yeah I've seen that before too . C: Yeah . A: Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . B: Yes . C: Yes . C: Yeah so it's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys Yeah . A: Mm . D: Mm . A: But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . D: That's what you mean ? B: Yes I I th that's what I mean so I mean something like like a book . C: Yeah . A: I like this one . A: I like the shape of this one . C: Yeah . A: Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something . D: Yeah I like also this one . D: Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or Okay . C: Yeah , mm . A: Mm mm 'kay . C: We should make a Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be Yeah that would depend upon us actually . A: Is this for the next meeting though ? A: I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . B: Mm . B: Ju just make two designs , and the we we can decide decide between th those designs . D: Yeah yeah yeah . A: Yep . C: Yeah okay . B: I think that would be a good idea . D: Perfect . B: So anyone uh any questions for now ? C: No no . A: No . C: I don't have . A: So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? B: Um yes I come to that uh uh Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . C: Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . A: Mm . A: Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? B: I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible . A: Mm . A: Okay . B: So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email . A: Yep . D: Exactly . C: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Two or three prototypes ? C: Two . B: Two . D: Two ? C: One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them , yeah that's how it is . B: I Mm and then Hmm . D: Okay . A: Mm . D: Yeah and find maybe a compromise . A: Hmm . B: Yes okay . D: Perfect yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yep . B: Okay let's call this to an end . A: Mm 'kay . C: Okay . A: Thanks guys . D: Thanks . C: So we are done for now .","summary":"Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive. She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate. She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens. The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms. He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his\/her tasks will be until the next meeting. The marketing expert will look for the cost inventories of other devices, such as speech recognition. She will also start evaluating the team's work if possible. The industial and interface designer will work together on the two prototypes (one cost-effective and one higher-end). They will recieve further instructions by email. They decide that the keys on the remote should be smooth, big, and there should not be too many. They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip, so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting on conceptual design, participants Anna, Matthew, and others gathered to discuss innovative ideas for a new remote control. Despite Matthew's late arrival, the team delved into presentations on making the product stand out through unique design and functionality.

A: Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . A: Might be seat floor rather than person . A: Yeah , put it back . C: Yeah . C: And do you think it's . A: Yep . A: Yeah . A: Jo's making faces at me . B: Okay . C: Yeah . B: So . B: Matthew is uh late again . A: Mm-hmm . B: Probably an important man . B: Um . B: So well it is important for him to be here uh . C: Yeah . C: So what can you ? B: He he he You did work together didn't you ? C: Yeah we will yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . B: Yes . C: I think we can put on the here . B: Yes . B: Yes . C: Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . B: Mm . B: Um yes but w we Yes , maybe we should phone him . C: Um , can we have a phone , can someone it's really w well designed . B: Um well Um , when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . A: Mm . A: Mm , object tracking . B: Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again . C: Yeah . A: Okay . B: And um well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . C: Kay . B: It's uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . B: There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . B: So we have to consider that . C: Yep . B: Good . B: Um so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . A: Well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . B: Okay Matthew . B: Nice uh you are here . C: Great . B: Great . B: Great . B: Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . C: Yep . C: So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . A: Mm-hmm . C: And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . A: Mm 'kay . D: Or browse . C: And also it's not too far from um a mobile . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . C: So people are used to that kind of shape , right . D: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah . D: Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . C: So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , the on-off button , in red . B: Eye . A: Mm-hmm . D: I yeah . D: L_E_D_ . A: Mm-hmm . C: Here would be the volume . A: Oh yeah . C: On the on the left , okay , so easy to turn on t and off . B: Uh-huh . D: Mm-hmm , hmm . B: Yes . C: And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . D: Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? D: Oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . C: Okay yeah . D: No no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . C: Yeah yeah . B: Ah , okay . D: So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . A: Mm-hmm . D: The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . D: And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only Mm . D: Actually . D: It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Mm . C: Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . B: Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: So this one model and uh yeah . A: Can I see ? A: Thanks . D: Sure . A: Okay I like the volume control , that's good . D: Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . A: Uh-huh . C: Yeah . A: So it doesn't actually have buttons . D: So that uh then what we look t yeah . A: Did you wanna see ? B: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah no you can carry on , I just look how it feels all . D: This is a model , yeah . B: Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . A: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Yep . B: Just I'm I really want to talk to it . C: Yeah actually , yeah . B: But . A: It won't talk back . B: So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm . D: Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . A: Right . B: Mm . D: And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . C: Play , pause . B: Mm-hmm . B: From D_V_D_ player to television or something . C: Exactly yeah . D: I really can change it , so Instead of having many switches , y The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . B: Yes . C: To audio and to video on demand . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah . C: Yes . B: Mm-hmm . C: This is the orange button , the microphone . B: Mm-hmm . C: An yeah . D: And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . D: And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover you know . C: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Crazy dis designer , okay . D: Design enter . B: Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? D: Yeah . C: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . D: Yeah . D: It's basically to do that . C: Yeah . B: But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be That th that's true . D: Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . C: Oh actually well . B: Mm . D: Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yes . B: Yes , more robust . B: Yes okay . A: Mm . D: Uh yeah . D: And you have very good chances Yeah . C: It's low weight . C: You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . C: So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs . D: It Sixteen Euros . C: Sixteen Euros sorry . B: Okay . A: So it's well outside the budget then . C: Then it's out of budget . C: But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . B: But w Mm 'kay . C: And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry . D: Yeah . D: Three Euros . C: And um No no no , part of that , yeah . A: That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? D: Part of that . A: So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . C: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything . B: Mm-hmm . C: Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then it's too Locati . A: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: What's this one on the side ? D: Ah that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside . C: Location . A: Ah okay . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Mm 'kay . A: I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape . D: Yeah . B: Well well Mm . B: Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um Yes . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . B: Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . A: Okay . A: Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . B: Mm-hmm . A: We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep . B: Well just do it quickly if if we al already . A: So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so These are the things we identified as being important . A: Um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . B: Mm-hmm . A: And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . A: So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? B: Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . A: Okay . A: So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . A: Not sure how this is gonna come out . A: So the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? A: Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a Mm-hmm . B: And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Functionality . A: Okay so look and feel , innovation Mm-hmm . D: And now it easy to use . C: Easy to use . B: Mm . C: target . A: And trends . A: Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? A: Is that part of both of them or ? B: Um well w w we can still discuss that . A: Okay . B: So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? A: Mm-hmm . C: No . D: No . B: No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . A: No . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . A: Okay . A: Yep . A: So it's the pink . B: Th th this is the first design . A: And the other one's green . B: Yes . A: Okay , so look and feel ? A: Where um one is I've broken the pen again . B: Uh there is another pen . A: S yeah . A: Get that one . A: Um w one's bad and seven's the best . A: Sorry , one's true and seven's false . A: One's the best . B: Okay . A: So on a scale of one to seven ? B: Kay . B: Okay . B: So . B: Look and feel . B: Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think . B: In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then i it looks quite conventional . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . B: Don't you agree ? D: Mm yeah . A: On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , so Mm-hmm . B: So maybe two . B: Hmm . B: Hmm . B: Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five I It's my opinion , but I don't know what what Four , four . D: Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . C: Yeah . D: It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know . C: Yeah . C: Four maybe . A: Four ? D: Four yeah that Yeah . A: Okay . B: Now we th th then we settle on four . A: Mm-hmm . D: I will gi yeah . C: Uh . B: Kay . B: Can you maybe fix the other Mm , try it , just try it . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: If you press like this not like this then you But Okay . A: No that's the ink's dried . D: No . D: C can you get the batteries ? D: No no the battery has fallen down , that's i Yeah . A: Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? A: The b that's the that that one ? A: battery there . D: No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery . D: Okay ? D: Now it should be . A: Mm . A: No I think it's lost a battery . A: No it's It would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . B: Oh it will not ri mm , mm . D: Is there another battery there ? D: Oh yeah . A: You got a second ? C: Try a Perfect . A: Well we won't be able to tell . B: Yes , it it has a mm . A: Is that working ? A: Did it come out ? A: Good . A: Okay . B: Good . B: Good . A: Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . C: Yeah , yeah . C: Yep . B: Okay . B: So then then Ah . A: And the other one ? C: Wow . A: I think it's slightly better , um , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but Mm . B: Mm . B: I I I When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component . B: It it it it breaks in your Mm , yes I see , mm okay . C: Kay maybe It's not a button it's a led , it's a Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . D: No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's n i it is jus It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something . A: Mm . A: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Oh you can push push it again , you can push it . A: Yeah . A: The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? D: Yeah . A: Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: No you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that Uh it's fine I think . A: Okay . B: Well r r Mm . A: I'd say two or three for that one , personally . A: Probably more towards three than two . B: I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . B: So so I would also say this is four . A: Okay . B: But w w do you what do you think ? D: My just that um the feel is that um you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . C: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yes . D: This is how embedded one will Yeah . B: Yes , it basically is the same shape . D: It's a bas basically the same thing actually . B: Mm-hmm . D: You will be Except that in this c Yeah . B: Mm . C: And the L_C_D_ makes it better . C: Yeah . D: And you might have a slight thing for to forward and Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Mm , okay . B: Yeah . C: So I will say two . A: Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . B: Yes , okay . C: I would say two , three . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: So , consensus ? A: Two or three ? B: Two ? B: Mm . A: Two ? C: Yep . B: Two's good yes . D: looking like No but except for the design of the surf . A: Um , 'kay . A: Innovation . A: The first one , not really muc Mm . C: Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , right ? A: Yeah . A: Do we Mm . C: Yeah . C: The surf uh design . B: Mm . A: What What features are we actually including ? D: You should be rea Uh no I think it's more of the feel . A: Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? A: There's nothing like that ? A: But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . D: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: The only innova innovation is the shape . C: Yeah . D: Say about that . A: Okay . B: S so that Mm . A: So there's no this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: You're right . A: So I'd be up for seven for innovation . C: Yeah . C: And the And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . D: Yep . C: And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . D: Yeah , it gives it Yep . B: Yes . B: A and the L_C_D_ screen is That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . C: Yeah . C: And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . B: Mm . C: Uh could put it at one or two I would say . A: Okay . B: Yeah . C: Personally . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? A: Got the L_C_D_ screen . C: Uh Yeah automatic speech recognition . A: Is that in this one though ? A: Is this 'cause this is the Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . D: No , we ha Yeah , eight Euros yeah . B: We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget . A: Okay . C: Yeah . A: So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? C: So Eight . A: Eight Euros ? B: Eight . C: Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . A: And this one was sixteen Euros . B: Yes . C: Sixteen . D: Sixteen Euros . A: Okay . A: So . A: Innovation for this one is two ? A: One ? D: It's a two , I would say two . A: Two ? C: W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see okay , one would would be without buttons , . B: Two . B: Why it is one . B: A man w w Yes . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , so Give it a one ? C: Bu Yeah . C: So maybe we can put one . B: This this is it w with the speech recognition ? C: It's using speech recognition , yeah . D: Okay yeah . B: Well . B: Gi given that that it works , then it's I think one . C: Yeah , one , yeah . A: Yep . A: Okay . A: Ease of use ? D: Uh He is used to it act They are used to it actually . C: So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , right ? A: Mm . A: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Yep . A: So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . C: Yeah . D: Here there may Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . C: Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . A: Okay . B: Hmm . D: It shouldn't be diffi Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be Yeah Yeah but y Well we have reduced the keys actually you see . A: So maybe a three or a four . C: One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . A: Mm . C: And there is a like I would say three . C: Or maybe four . A: Okay . A: Consensus ? A: Three or four ? B: Three , I would . D: Three is fine with me . C: Yeah , yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , This one would be uh for grandmothers . A: Three ? B: Three . A: Okay . D: Yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal . B: No . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . D: Is quite easy yeah . B: So so I think th three is good . D: Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Good . B: What's the next ? A: So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic . D: Mm . A: So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? B: So Twe twenty to forty , yes that's Mm-hmm . A: That's Mm . D: Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . C: No . C: Yeah , grandmothers , yeah . D: Yeah . A: So sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing . D: And Oh yeah , . B: Well exce except for the surfing shape . C: Yeah that's true . B: I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , but Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah . C: Yeah . A: That's it's still Ye Mm . A: Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that's right . B: But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Do you agree ? A: And Mm . D: I Well I think Yeah . C: Yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , right ? D: Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . C: Yeah . C: But w Yeah . A: But it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with i we've got a set price . D: So And people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a Okay . C: But for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . B: Mm , yeah , indeed . A: Yeah . A: There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . B: Th t t Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper . C: Yeah . D: Okay . D: So in that case well it's fine then . C: Yeah . D: We can yeah . B: Mm . A: Okay . B: Mm . B: Okay . A: Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? D: And the demographics of Yeah I think it's uh it has more market actually . A: It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen and Mm . B: Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the Mm . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . A: Mm-hmm . B: So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , yes . A: Yeah . B: Because it Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , so . A: I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . C: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Okay . B: Wh what what No s say t two . A: I'd probably go with three again for that one . C: Or even Even one and two . A: Mm-hmm . D: Y yeah , you know two . C: Or two . A: Okay . A: So , two , yeah ? B: Two ? C: Yeah . C: Two yeah . D: Yeah two yeah . D: Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . A: Mm-hmm . D: Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to We have to practically test it . A: Yeah . A: Yep . A: And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy . D: The field test will tell you how good . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Okay , the final point , trends . A: And following the trends . D: The trends . A: So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: So as it is , not really doing either of them . B: I think Mm . C: Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . D: Mm-hmm . A: Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy . C: Uh okay . D: Yeah I know . C: But this one includes this feature , right ? C: Spongy buttons . D: Yeah . D: We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . A: So it's sort of , yeah . A: Mm . C: So Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . A: Okay . B: Mm . A: But that's if you're using the covers . B: And the then we can al yes . C: Yeah . A: Or is it just one Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . B: We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? B: I mean Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh I th I th I think O o or just two things which can be put on each other . D: But why do you want to cover that actually ? D: In that uh w in the mod Uh uh y are you sure ? A: So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . C: Yeah . C: This is possible . D: Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah exactly like Nokia phones . A: Mm . B: Yes , exactly like it . D: Yep . B: Uh , so Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features . A: Mm-hmm . A: I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion . B: Mm . B: Mm mm mm mm mm . C: Yeah . C: Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . A: Mm . A: Mm . A: Mm . C: So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . A: Mm . A: Yep . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . A: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . B: Yes . B: So so so that that would make the trends equal , so we we we really have don't have , I mean Mm . C: Yeah . A: Mm . A: There's n yeah . A: Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . A: Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . C: Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two . B: Yes , indeed . A: Okay . A: So . A: Two and three , or one and two ? B: Yes . D: Yeah , it's one . B: Say , say one and two . B: One and two . A: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . B: So le le let's see . B: So d this one has spongy but buttons ? A: Okay . D: Yeah , it says a One point six , one point One point eight yeah . C: Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . B: Mm , I see , yes okay . A: Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five mm nine by five , one point s eight ? B: Good . B: Just add it . C: Nine . B: You know . B: Three , six , seven . A: This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two yep . D: Four point Uh four point two . C: Very good . A: Okay . A: But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . B: Mm-hmm . B: We we must try to get them closer . C: Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . A: Yep . B: Both in i i or we just have to choose . D: Wow . B: And adapt . B: Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . A: Yep . A: Mm-hmm . A: Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . A: That'll basically take us down to the budget . B: Yes , well But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? C: So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . B: Mm . C: Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one . D: Yeah . D: Yep . B: Mm , tha Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . D: Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . B: So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that . D: Mm-hmm . B: It's a it's a normal battery , or Yes . D: Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . D: What do you say , Mael ? C: For this one it's a normal battery . B: Just so one battery . B: Kay . B: Electronics . B: given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . D: Yeah . C: Uh sample speaker , yeah . B: Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . C: Sample , yeah , this one . B: Yes , this one . B: Okay . B: Case ? B: Um , I see I Double curve . C: So So which one are we talking to ? D: Curved . D: Double curved yeah right . D: It's uh Are you talking about this or that ? A: Mm . A: Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . B: Mm . C: Well Yeah . A: Either of them . B: Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu So th th this would be double curves ? D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: They're both going to be not basic cases . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: Kay . B: Uh , plastic would be the material . A: Yeah . A: The basic one , yep . C: Is it zero Franc ? D: A special colour ? B: Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . D: Uh Ah good . A: So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . B: Push . B: Mm , yes , but Yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components . C: L_C_D_ is . C: It's okay . C: Just say L_C_D_ . A: Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? A: So it would need twelve buttons . D: Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? C: No but for this one it's twelve Euro . D: No , for that one also . C: There are twelve ? B: So , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , t Yes . D: Yeah that's a scroll . B: Twelve I believe . B: So this comes to eighteen . A: Mm . A: And that's without any special button supplements . D: Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . B: So So I think but th do you agree th that thi Yes I Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . A: So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . A: They're not just standard buttons . D: Uh Bad estimate , right ? C: Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? C: Because it's there is no like . A: But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . C: Well it's you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave . B: Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . A: You talking about concave curves ? B: Uh-huh . C: So I think we can put um the single curved in the sixteen . B: Both . A: You think a single curved ? C: That makes uh seventeen . C: And what are just The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? C: Yeah . A: Mm . B: Yes . B: Uh W d we have we haven't talk about a , but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list . A: We have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah The sc Mm . C: So I had a bad uh bad estimation . A: We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . B: W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? C: No no no . A: Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . C: Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . A: So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . C: Okay , so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker But still , yeah it No we cannot , yeah . D: That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . B: So um We're We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? D: We just need that actually . D: We need one . B: Yes ? B: So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . C: So But the um Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . D: S Oh I i it I think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . B: Transti Say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so Yes but that maybe Well we can just say one . C: Right , Matthew ? C: Or regular chip ? C: I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . C: Yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay . D: Yeah . C: So . C: And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew ? D: Uh Yeah . C: When you look at this w , this u uh item , But You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , no ? B: Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . B: So is it possible ? A: But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . D: That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . B: Mm-hmm . B: No no , he he he I I Mm-hmm . A: Well So the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . C: And uh we don't want to to change that right ? C: We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . D: Uh Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . B: Mm-hmm . B: Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . C: It's evident . C: Yeah . A: Mm . A: So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . C: And I dunno So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um Do you think it's important ? B: Mm . A: And the chip . A: Sorry the chip's up there already . B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A: So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . B: A Mm Mm . C: Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? C: I dunno , I'm just asking . D: A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . A: Mm . A: Yep . A: Mm . A: Yeah . A: I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . D: Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons . C: Yeah , it's true yeah . C: But uh , do we want that ? C: On the market point of view , yeah . C: What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? B: I I think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so Yes . A: For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . A: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . C: You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? C: Okay . B: Yes . B: Yes . C: Okay . B: One man one vote . B: S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? A: I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . A: I can't see it fitting in . B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . D: I think but Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . C: We need to be . A: Bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager . B: Mm-hmm , I know , but Yes . C: Yeah . A: well we have to make a decision now , that's it . D: Yeah . B: So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . B: Is that acceptable ? B: Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an You've you you agree . C: Yes . D: W I I I just Yeah . B: So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . B: So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . C: Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . B: Mm . C: Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . A: Mm . A: I think then we we're really losing ease of use . C: Okay , . D: That will create another problem . D: For the people to use it . D: It's not going to be easy . A: Okay . C: Okay . B: Mm . D: Doing that . B: So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . B: That that's that's my opinion . D: No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons . B: Just Uh where , L_C_ Okay w we now we can just uh Yes . A: Okay . A: So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? A: We've Yep . C: The speech recognition is out . C: Because of the budget , yeah . A: Yep . A: So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? A: Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . D: Yeah . A: With these new costings . C: Yes . A: So just look at forget that one and look at that one now . C: Yeah . B: Yes . B: I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , okay . A: Mm . A: Yep . A: Okay . B: My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . A: Well that's that's Yep . C: Actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . A: So . A: Mm . D: Yeah . A: Yep . B: Okay . A: So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . B: Okay , good . B: Then we the same . B: Thank you . D: Okay . B: That was it . A: Mm-hmm . D: That's it . C: Thanks . D: Cool . A: Okay .","summary":"As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up\/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth. It also has a power button, channel up\/down, slow pause\/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone. It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel, innovation, ease of use, appeal to the correct demographic, and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. They discuss the energy source, shape, chip type, LCD and speech recognition, and additional buttons. After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. They close the meeting by thanking one another. NA. The remote will be double-curved. The energy source will be a normal AA battery. Shaped like a surfboard. Made of plastic. Will contain a regular chip. Have no LCD screen or speech recognition. Addition of two buttons. Production cost 12 Euros, 50 cents cheaper than budget. Will talk to the suppliers to see if they can lower prices and add a few more features. The group created two design prototypes to choose from. When they rated both products, they found that the basic version was not innovative enough but the advanced version was too costly. They eliminated many of the features of the advanced version, eventually bringing them near to the basic. It was a long and tedious process, taking much time for them to reach an agreement since some felt an LCD screen was necessary and others did not.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize the design and budget for a new remote control, the team, consisting of Anna, Matthew, and Jo, discussed various features and costs. They debated the inclusion of an L_C_D_ display and speech recognition, considering the impact on the budget of \u20ac12.50 per unit. Anna highlighted the importance of appealing to the target demographic of twenty to forty-year-olds and incorporating trendy elements like fruit and vegetable-inspired designs. Despite initial aspirations for innovation, they realized the need to prioritize cost-effectiveness. Ultimately, they decided to forego the L_C_D_ display and speech recognition to meet the budget constraints, opting for a simpler design with seven buttons instead of twelve. The team agreed to revisit suppliers to negotiate prices and potentially add more features within the set budget. The meeting concluded with a consensus to proceed with the revised design plan, ensuring it aligns with both financial limitations and market expectations. Action items included further cost negotiations and design adjustments to meet the target price point.","relevance":0.3060036898,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the budget set for the new remote control design?","answer":"The budget set for the new remote control design was \u20ac12.50 per unit."},{"question":"What demographic was the team targeting with the new remote control design?","answer":"The team was targeting the demographic of twenty to forty-year-olds."},{"question":"What features were considered trendy for the new remote control design?","answer":"Trendy features considered included fruit and vegetable-inspired designs."},{"question":"What decision did the team make regarding the inclusion of the L_C_D_ display and speech recognition in the design?","answer":"The team decided to forego the L_C_D_ display and speech recognition to meet the budget constraints."}]}

A: So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . A: So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . A: And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . A: So sorry ? B: Uh . B: Just one thing . B: Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true . B: I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah . A: You have another meeting soon ? A: So you have to be quick . B: Yeah , for the lawnmower project . A: Okay . B: Okay . A: So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . A: So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . A: First it will be the functional design . A: Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . A: So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . A: And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . A: And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . A: So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . B: What an original idea . A: Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? B: Orangutan . A: Okay that's good . C: No no n You should write y the name I think . A: n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment . B: Can I give you the no ? B: But I don't have to say anything . B: When I'm drawing the orangutan . B: It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . A: Okay it's an abstract drawing . B: Yes . A: I think it's nice and original . B: I don't have a red colour . B: Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so Yes . A: Okay . A: You want to draw something Christine ? D: Okay uh sorry . D: You have to imagine a little bit um . D: This Sorry too uh . A: Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . B: Yes . B: I know . A: Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty . B: Wha what is this strange beast ? D: Is it beautiful ? B: Is it a monster ? D: Do you know ? D: It's a cat . B: It's a cat ? D: Isn't it ? B: I thought these things did not exist . D: Yes yes is it like that . C: Me Ah yeah . D: Is it better ? B: Ah yeah Does have a name ? C: Yeah . D: Okay . D: It's my cat . A: Okay it's your cat . D: Yeah . D: The name is Caramel . B: Caramel . C: Caramel . B: Ah-ha . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Olivier , do you want to Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . C: And you I think I'm too short for the cables . B: Next time I concentrate . A: I'm a bit short on cable . A: Okay . A: So what could I draw ? A: Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . A: I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what ? B: He looks like a bong . B: Okay . B: Sorry . B: No . C: Quite squarey . B: Scary ? C: He also . A: I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say . C: Mm . B: I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos , no . A: Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . B: That's I is there a matter for a new remote control ? A: Okay . A: Let's move on . A: So Here the uh financial objective of our project . A: That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . A: Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . B: Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? A: We have to discuss that point . B: Ah this is not defined at all ? A: On yeah you you can suggest points like this . B: Ah , okay . A: So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . A: So what's what are your ideas about that ? A: Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? B: Well uh do we sell other stuff ? B: Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . A: Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . B: Yeah . A: Do you agree ? C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: So maybe it should be for multiple devices . A: And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? C: I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . B: No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . C: I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . A: Few buttons . A: Okay . A: And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? A: Might be a good idea . C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ? C: Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . B: Mm . A: With rou okay . A: Like for okay . B: Something like that , least fits in your hand . C: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Yeah . B: The basic requirement . A: So . A: Fit in your hand , yeah . B: Only a buck . A: And also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . C: Mm-hmm . B: Waterproof . A: Water-proof as well . C: And I think we should have a device Sorry . A: Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't . A: Maybe water-proof would be very original . A: Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . B: Mm . A: That could be uh Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah , mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . B: B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . B: That's people they actually do it themselves . C: Yeah . C: directly . B: I it will look a bulky in that case . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . A: That might be good uh track to follow . B: Like as an optional thing . A: Optional or selled with it ? C: And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . C: We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . A: Yeah . A: Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_ . C: Ah yeah . A: Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . C: Yeah . B: Barks . A: Yeah , barks , yeah . C: Barks . A: So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? C: Yeah . C: Yeah whistle . A: I don't know , whistle-able ? C: Whistle tracking . A: Th Whistle tracking yeah . A: Whistle tracking remote control . A: That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . B: That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? A: Yeah d d uh . B: So i it's just going to add t to the cost . A: Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . A: I think this is a good advantage . B: It's cool . B: I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget . A: Yeah . A: We have to ask Yeah . B: Who's Yeah . A: We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Which is you . B: Kay . C: yeah Okay . A: Okay so try to find that for next meeting . A: Okay . A: So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . C: Don't panic . A: Don't pani . A: So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . C: Mm-hmm . A: So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . B: Mm-hmm . A: And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . A: So . A: And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . B: Mm . A: So . A: Thank you I think that's all for this point . B: Good . C: Mm-hmm . B: Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? B: Half an hour . A: Anyway you will receive some messages . A: Be careful . A: You eat it ? A: Does it move uh ? A: Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see . C: Ah .","summary":"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals.

C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . C: Mm-hmm . B: So there is one that is one thing . B: The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . B: Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah . C: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . B: So I think it should be a package in that case . B: Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . B: One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . B: Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Yeah ? C: What do you mean by linear access then ? B: Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . C: Ah . B: Um . A: Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ? B: Mm ? A: So the better now for special navigation ? B: Yeah . B: For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? A: Okay . A: Then linear access then random access . B: Uh . B: Mm . B: Yeah and also parameter changing . A: Ah yeah parameter okay . B: So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay and and voice command did you uh Okay . B: Voice command w we could specify anything . B: We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . A: Okay . B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Yeah . A: So that's uh that close your investigations ? B: Yeah . B: Uh yeah I think so . A: Okay . B: Not so far . A: Okay . A: Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with I dunno if I can open it . D: Yeah . D: Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here . A: Maybe you can s It's Messenger no ? D: Uh in yeah okay . D: No . D: In document . D: Mm computer yeah . A: In which folder ? B: Where did you put it ? D: Here . D: Here . A: Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? B: mm . D: But it's not Um . A: Maybe you can send it to me by email . A: Just to participant one . A: At AMI . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , I can do that . A: I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . D: Okay . D: Um . A: You send it ? D: It's participant one ? A: Yeah . A: Uh this is this email . B: I'm designing the user interface . D: Okay . D: You can uh . A: Okay . A: So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . D: Yeah . A: So okay , functional requirements . D: Okay so you can you can go . D: Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay ? A: Mm . A: Yeah . D: And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice , more kind . D: Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . D: Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good . D: So okay . D: So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah . A: We can just keep doing that ? A: Yeah . D: Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . D: So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that . D: Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . A: Okay . D: Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . A: Okay . D: So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or Yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? D: F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons . A: Okay . B: But what kind of remote controls did you look at ? D: Sorry ? B: What kind of task was it ? B: It was a T_V_ ? D: Yeah . D: Uh most for most is T_V_ . A: Yeah . A: Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . B: Huh . B: Uh-huh . B: Ah ! Good . A: Okay . D: Kay you can go so . D: So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it . A: Yeah . A: To find it . A: Yeah . D: Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . A: Yeah . D: So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . D: And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ um I dunno . A: What is her other side ? B: Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist . B: It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . A: Oh yeah ? B: Yeah . A: I did not knew that . B: If you also up on a computer in a strange position . A: Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . B: Ergonomic . B: But uh . B: Have to say ha ha . D: Yeah . A: It's your job Oh . D: Uh . A: Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft . D: Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . A: Yeah . A: Yeah yeah . A: Yeah . D: Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . A: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . D: So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and Very accessible yes . A: Yeah . A: This function should be very uh accessible . A: Yeah , okay . D: That's right . A: This is the main function okay . D: So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: The first question . D: So you know that um for the younger it's very important to have the s yes and speech recognition . A: To have L_C_D_ and voice . D: And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . A: Okay . D: So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . A: Yeah maybe this this is important . D: Yeah . A: Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so . B: Mm . D: Mm . A: Yeah . D: Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . D: So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . A: Okay . D: Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to An I s no , yeah . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Okay these are the user requi Yeah . D: I dunno if you see something else important or Mm . C: I'm just thinking of some thing . C: Um We want to have a no , I don't know if this is a good idea . C: We want to have a a general remote control for everything . A: No no no . A: We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . C: Okay . A: From the management board I receive an email . B: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . C: Yeah . C: Yeah yeah . C: Yeah . B: Mm I it's not true I think . B: The the second claim that you put . C: No no . A: That it would be too long to develop . B: Yeah . B: I think that should be the same . A: Oh yeah . A: Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . A: So maybe it's a good decision . A: I dunno . A: What's your opinion ? B: I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . B: I don't think Uh yeah . C: Finish tonight . B: Yeah . B: Okay . C: But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so . B: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . A: Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know . C: If fact Yeah but Do I have oh yeah . D: Mm . C: Now I have enough cables . B: Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . C: Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . C: We just have sorry , I'm going Like that . A: Okay . A: Are you okay ? C: I'm just going to describe . C: Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . C: After that we just have um user interface . C: Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . C: Push button or a L_C_D_ . C: After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . C: So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . C: And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy . A: U_C_ is the central unit ? C: Yeah . A: Okay yeah . C: Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display . A: Computation . A: Okay . C: And so for us uh this is quite easy . C: We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television . A: Okay . C: So for us this is quite easy . A: Okay so this is quite easy . C: Yeah . C: Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple Yeah of course of course . A: There is not that much constraints . B: This will think this will take more time to develop also . B: Yeah . C: And um but for a standard one this is really easy . C: It's a question of one month and so on s No no no no , I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . B: Soon . A: To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ? A: Standard button one . B: Yeah . B: So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Definitely . B: Yeah . A: So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? C: I would say . B: Ten years . C: I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . A: Okay so i it's a bit long yeah . C: Yeah . C: I can Um . A: One month for the standard one with button . C: Yeah . A: Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ? C: Yeah even . C: I mean that this is really standard devices now . C: Um eight . C: For uh speech recognition . A: Okay yeah . A: Okay so we can take this into account . A: So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? B: But we don't have time to market . C: And also how much uh I think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a Yeah but how many yeah . A: Yeah it will . B: I think we should contact management . A: Euros . A: Yeah , yeah . B: Well . A: Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros . B: Uh How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . B: Eh chips . B: We're gonna need chips right . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? C: Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . B: Okay . A: Because we are It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . B: So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition . C: Yeah , we can Mm-hmm . B: Yeah ? B: Okay . B: So . B: No it doesn't . B: Okay . B: Four million . A: Okay . A: Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . D: Mm . C: Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ? A: Yeah I I will continue . C: Is it Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . A: Well ask your question if you want . D: Mm ? D: Yeah . C: Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? D: Oh . C: To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . D: Would j Uh yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . C: And But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? D: But Yeah . A: It's not intuitive first . C: You say that I want , I have six button Yeah . B: Mh-hmm . B: A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: But , but also it seems that Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Okay . B: So I mean there are markets and markets . B: I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . B: Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . B: I guess . B: I don't know if there is study about that . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product . D: Mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Mm . D: Mm . B: And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: All right ? C: Yeah . B: Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . D: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . B: Yeah . A: Losed lose it etcetera . B: Mm-hmm . A: These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . D: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . A: So but le let us see first the new requirement . A: So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . B: But teletext is just one button . B: You you just write the write the numbers . A: Yeah . A: So well Yeah . B: So will you add with the channel keys , right ? B: So . A: So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s Yeah . B: I am . B: I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button . B: So . A: I dunno . A: If i one button is still one more button . A: If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . B: Mm-hmm . A: Well anyway I have this point . A: We can discuss . A: Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . A: And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . A: So this is the the key point . A: So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . B: Capital . D: Mm . A: So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ? D: Mm . C: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . B: Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple . A: Yeah okay . A: So yeah the key point here is simple . A: Maybe . A: So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ? B: Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see really . A: Yeah . A: Maybe switch T_V_ on and off Yeah . B: Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us . B: Or something . A: Yeah . A: Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . C: Mm . A: And that's all ? C: Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . B: It's a memory , yeah . A: Okay . A: Yeah this is cool . A: Maybe we can include that also . A: Previous previous channel button . A: So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: And uh and of course the channel changing buttons . A: Yeah . A: I I talk about that , yeah ? B: How should they how should we implement that ? B: Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental . A: Yeah . A: Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them . B: Mm-hmm . C: Let's say that we can do something like that . C: This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . A: We go faster ? C: To go fa to go faster . A: Mm . B: Mm . B: It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . B: So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No . C: Yeah . B: Doesn't work does it . A: Maybe we should have also a digit button Yeah . B: Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . B: Change channel to eight . B: No . A: Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . A: I dunno bec because if you have the Uh . B: Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental . A: Yeah . A: Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: So I think we need also digits . C: Okay . A: Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits . B: Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Or we can do something like that . C: We can design the remote control to have access . C: You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y You Yeah , a kind of joystick . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . B: Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , and uh yeah I think this is the basi And do we do we have a No , a wheel is better . C: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . B: On the lower side I think it you have to turn it . B: No ? B: If we do that . C: Or a or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to Yeah . B: Yeah . A: I would say the wheel is better . B: Because of that Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah ? A: What is the expert of uh Okay . B: The channels change one by one . C: Yeah . B: So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit . C: Yeah , the yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: That's a good idea . A: Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control . C: S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel . A: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh whatever , yeah . C: A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um . A: Yeah , and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? B: Yeah . A: Because it was important for young customers if you remember . B: I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . C: Yeah . B: If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . B: Just increase the cost . A: Okay . B: The user does not have an advantage really . A: So no L_C_D_ ? C: Mm-hmm . D: Hmm . A: And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process . C: Okay . B: Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool . B: It would . B: Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . D: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . A: Yeah . A: That would be cool . A: But eight months is really long and Maybe we can just uh Okay . B: Yeah . C: Ten years Mm-hmm . A: So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . A: So thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . B: Yeah . A: That would be easier . D: Mm . B: What is the folder that you put yours in ? B: And did it it did work ? D: No . A: No it did not work . D: No no . A: She send it to me by email . B: Ah yeah . D: I dunno , I dunno it . B: Mm . B: Okay . A: So maybe this is better , to send it by email . B: Okay what is your email ? A: Okay ? A: So yeah I I'm it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that , it's here . B: At participant one . B: Okay . A: Participant one at AMI . A: Okay . A: So see you after lunch break . D: Kay thank you . B: Well during lunch break actually . B: So next time we should have a fight . B: How about uh management or something . B: Who happens to be your friend .","summary":"The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. The group decided to include a previous channel change button to the standard remote buttons, and to have a wheel for changing channels in increments, with a smaller number pad below it. The remote will not have an LCD screen. The remote will not include speech recognition. The group experienced many technical difficulties with their presentations; all participants encountered problems when opening their presentations.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, the team gathered to discuss user requirements, technical design, and project updates. Led by A, the meeting involved participants B, C, and D, who engaged in a detailed discussion on the features of a new remote control. B presented on the desired functions, including controls for TVs, robotic pets, and whole-house systems, emphasizing the importance of a user-friendly interface with voice commands. D shared insights from user observations, highlighting the need for an ergonomic design and simplified functionality. The team debated the inclusion of features like speech recognition and LCD screens, considering the cost implications and development timelines. They decided to focus on a TV-specific remote control to expedite market entry and enhance brand visibility. Action items included designing a simple remote with essential functions like channel and volume controls, a previous channel button, and an incremental wheel for navigation. The team agreed to forego complex features like teletext and speech recognition to streamline development. Financially, they aimed to keep costs below \u20ac12.50 per unit and target revenue of \u20ac50 million by selling four million units. The meeting concluded with action items assigned, presentations to be shared via email, and a plan to reconvene post-lunch for further discussions and decision-making.","relevance":0.4688757062,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were some of the desired functions for the new remote control?","answer":"Controls for TVs, robotic pets, and whole-house systems, with emphasis on a user-friendly interface and voice commands."},{"question":"What insights did participant D share from user observations?","answer":"Insights included the need for an ergonomic design, simplified functionality, and features like an incremental wheel for navigation."},{"question":"What decision was made regarding the inclusion of speech recognition and LCD screens in the remote control?","answer":"The team decided to forego these features due to cost implications and development timelines."},{"question":"What was the financial target set by the team for selling the remote controls?","answer":"To keep costs below \u20ac12.50 per unit and target revenue of \u20ac50 million by selling four million units."}]}
{"meeting_id":"IS1001c","dialogue":"A: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . A: So we are here for the concept design meeting . A: So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . A: Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . A: So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . A: We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . A: So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . A: We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . A: Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . A: We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . A: We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . A: So now uh we will have three presentations . A: So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . C: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . A: And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . A: So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . A: So this is the presentation . B: Uh , I_D_ you want ? A: Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . B: Yeah . B: I only v have three slides , so . B: I just look at the mm um just this . B: On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . A: Yeah . B: So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . B: And um yeah we can change directly . A: Yeah . B: In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . B: The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . A: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . B: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . A: Okay . B: Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . C: Yeah . A: But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? C: Mm . A: Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . B: Yeah . B: Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . A: So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? C: Yeah . A: Okay You received something Hmm . C: Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? B: But Um that's all yeah . C: No ? B: I haven't chec Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . C: Says Yeah . C: It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . C: But I guess it could be I guess it's possible . A: And could it be adapted ? C: I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . A: Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? C: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it . A: Okay . A: Yeah . A: Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . C: Okay . B: Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . B: Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that . A: Okay . B: We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . C: Mm-hmm . C: I have a question about that actually . C: Um , what is the purpose of the light ? B: Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah . C: Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? A: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? A: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? C: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . A: Hmm . C: You can see the buttons better , of course . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: True . B: Actually . C: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . B: As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . C: Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? B: Yeah . B: Again . C: Yeah no it's too expensive . B: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device Yeah , a little bit . C: Okay . C: Mm . C: Extra . C: Yeah , okay . C: Mm . C: Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah . C: Mm . C: Mm-hmm . A: But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? A: To have the light always on ? B: A little bit . C: Mm . A: Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations . B: Yeah . C: Okay . C: So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . A: Yeah . C: So . C: It was last time I saw it . A: And it is . C: Okay . C: So , just move to the next slide . A: Okay . C: So basically want very simple , right ? C: That's the major idea , as simple as possible . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . C: And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . C: And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . A: Yeah . C: Um . C: So . A: And also does it uh fit well in hand ? A: Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . C: Yeah . C: Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . C: We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? A: Yeah . C: These are the basic thing . A: So it's only the central part . C: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . A: Yeah . A: With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . C: Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . C: It could be on the right side , for example . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . C: And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . A: Okay . C: Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . A: Okay . A: S Okay . C: So that they're separate a bit , yeah . A: Will be down or Okay . C: Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . C: Mm . C: Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . A: Okay . C: Alright , you won't yeah . C: Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: That you want to protect a bit . C: And I think it's uh it's reasonable . A: Okay . C: So , I don't think Yeah , this is just the the wheel . C: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . A: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . C: Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . A: Yeah . A: Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . B: Mm-hmm . A: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . A: So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . B: To s Mm-hmm . C: Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . A: Okay . A: So we can move to the Is there any question ? A: For designer of user interface ? A: or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? A: Okay . D: Okay , I can go ? D: Can I ? A: Yeah . D: So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . D: So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . D: And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . A: Okay . D: And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . D: So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: And um so you you can go after . A: Yeah . D: And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . D: So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . A: Okay . B: I support an apple . D: Uh I don't know which material can be spongy , and if you Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: This is good also for Yeah . C: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . C: You can throw it to the television . A: Yeah , because it's robust . D: Okay It's robust , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Me too . C: Hey that's a cool one . C: We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . C: When it d uh takes a shock . A: Yeah uh sorry ? B: Ah it's okay . D: Not good . B: I know that they do that for alarm clock also . D: An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . C: Yeah . D: You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . A: No . A: Yeah . A: Before ? D: And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . B: Yeah . D: Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . A: Has it ? A: Yeah . A: I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . B: Mm-hmm . D: Innovative . A: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . D: Mm . C: How do we make it look cool is the question . A: Cool , fancy ? C: Yeah . A: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . D: Yeah . A: Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . B: What about um And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? D: Mm . D: Oh , colour , yeah . C: Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . D: Oh i i I thought about a a pear , for example . A: Maybe yeah . D: You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah . A: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . A: A pear . C: The banana is also ergonomic . A: Yeah . A: Maybe pear yeah or something like that . D: Or a fruit like that . D: I dunno . A: Yeah . A: We can discuss that uh . A: D D Is is there anything you want to add ? C: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? A: I don't think so . A: I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . C: Yeah . A: Something like that . A: But that's not in the trend . C: You can make it um It's not hard , the metal . B: Yeah . A: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . C: Plastic . B: Yep . A: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . B: Yeah . A: What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? C: Mm . A: Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . B: Banana I think , it's a nice idea . B: Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Two of the button , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: But you don't have Yeah . A: I think it's a good idea , yeah . C: Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . A: Yeah . C: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , no ? A: Yeah . A: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . A: Maybe we can keep the banana . A: And it will be very easy to find . C: You can put also vibrator inside . B: And everybody knows what is a banana . B: Basically . B: If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh , yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery ? C: Ah-ha . C: You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Yeah it's really uh really a good point . C: I hope the students of management die , but anyway . C: Now who are recording this meeting ? A: I think it So One second . A: So we have to take some decision on this aspect . A: So , uh so for sorry , for uh component , so we have to think about those aspects , sorry . A: Yeah . B: And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . B: Uh what do you mean by case ? A: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . B: Yeah . B: Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . B: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . C: The only th Yeah . C: Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . B: Yeah yeah . B: Yeah . C: But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? B: Spongy also . C: So , it's going to be bend a lot . C: So if we try to push the buttons , it You think it's possible ? B: Oh no I think it's possible . A: But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . B: Yeah . C: Okay . B: Yeah . B: This is uh like the Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Okay odd shape with spongy cover . A: And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . A: So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical . B: Wheel on the top . B: Button , where do we want some buttons ? C: Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? B: Yeah . C: Uh Yeah but okay . C: Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . B: Yep . B: Yep . C: Basically . C: Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . A: Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . C: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? A: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . C: Should have the two sides . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: So if the left , we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons . A: I think you can turn it this way also . A: You can do both with both hands . C: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . A: I think it's okay . C: So you cannot see them . A: Well , you you will get used to it . C: Yeah . A: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . C: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . A: Yeah . A: No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . A: I think for lefty it's okay . A: I can do this movement , and for righty as well . A: I think this doesn't change that much . C: Okay . A: Yeah ? C: Okay . C: Maybe . C: Yeah . A: So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . A: And and uh a wheel on the top . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: So the colour is yellow . A: I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . A: So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . A: So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . A: And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . A: That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . A: It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . B: Mm-hmm . A: So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . A: That would uh be better , I think . B: Yeah . A: And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . C: Mm-hmm . A: So do you need to add anything ? C: Yes master . C: No . A: You feel okay ? C: Yeah . A: You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? C: Yeah . A: You don't feel too constrained ? C: No . A: You don't feel free to answer this ? C: Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay . A: Okay , so See you . B: Thank you .","summary":"The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype, and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype. He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions. The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design. A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design. The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design. They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype, and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will construct a prototype for the product. The group will evaluate the prototype according to whether or not it meets the requirements of users. The group decided on the features that will be incorporated into the design of the prototype. The remote will be shaped and colored like a banana, and be covered in a spongy material. The buttons will be lighted. The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost. It will be placed at the top of the banana shape. The group decided to simply use a standard chip that will not accomodate speech recognition, as this feature will be eliminated from the functional design. The remote will use standard batteries. NA.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the concept design meeting, the team gathered to review decisions from the previous meeting and discuss investigations done by each member.

C: It is the essence of bananas . C: I would be confused with this thing . A: Mm . C: S How is everyone ? D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Hi . B: Hi . A: So we are here for the detailed design meeting . C: Mm-hmm . A: So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . A: Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . A: We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . A: And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . A: Then we will uh evaluate the product . A: And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . B: Mm-hmm . A: So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy , and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . C: Like a banana . B: Mm-hmm . A: And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . A: So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . B: Mm-hmm . A: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four . A: Yeah . A: You have a presentation ? A: Participant four , yes . D: Evaluation . A: Okay . A: Okay . D: Okay . D: So you can go . D: We can go through . A: Okay . D: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . D: So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . A: Okay . D: We we talked about before . A: Okay . D: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . A: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: Okay . D: So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . A: Yeah . D: Okay ? A: Okay . D: And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . D: The okay ? D: Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? A: Okay . A: Maybe you can presen okay . D: F between o one and seven . A: Maybe hold it . A: So I think it's uh very uh very nice . C: I give it a I give it a five . A: What do you think ? A: Yeah . A: So it's between one and seven ? D: Yeah . A: Seven is the highest uh ? D: Seven is the Mm-hmm . A: I will give a six . B: I will give a a five . C: And you ? D: sorry . C: Do you vote uh Christine ? D: eh ? C: Do you also vote ? D: No , I just want to see something Mm-hmm . A: Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah . C: Well , we can very easily . D: Uh I think uh and need to as well . A: No problem . D: Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh . A: So this is your One is most . C: I So it will have five point five average . D: Um . A: Well , we can choose what we want . D: Yeah . A: Okay , let's say that seven is the best . D: Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm . A: Okay . A: So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five . B: Five . A: And what what's your choice ? D: Oh sorry . D: Six Uh s you can how much what ? A: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? A: How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? D: Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh Yeah . A: Five point five average . D: Wa can . A: Okay . C: Mm . D: Okay . A: Well , does it Okay , techne technological aspect . D: I sorry . D: Okay . D: So after , the technological aspect ? D: So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . A: Yeah , we have the wheel . D: Uh . A: We also have the rubber material , which make it uh like new also . A: I think I would give a five . C: It's four . A: Four ? B: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . C: Yeah . B: The rubber is Uh a four . A: Okay . C: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? B: I I Yeah . A: No . C: Huh ? C: No . C: Okay . A: So what's your uh grade ? D: No . D: Four . A: Four ? A: So we have four , four f and five ? D: We can put four ? C: Yeah . C: For twenty five . A: Yeah , four . D: Everyone is okay or four poin Four . A: Four , yeah , let's put four . C: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Doesn't it Yeah , I think so . D: Very easy to use . D: Do you think it's easy to use ? C: I give a seven , I think . A: Yeah . B: Six . A: I would give a I would give a seven as well . A: It's very easy to use . D: Mm , six for me also . B: Six . A: So six point five . D: Six point five . C: Kay . B: Six six six point five . D: Okay . A: Okay . D: Is it fashion ? A: Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . D: Seven ? A: I would say seven . A: And is very very nice design . D: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the yeah , seven . C: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , seven . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Seven , okay . C: Well , we hope . B: Easy to find . D: Uh easy to find in a room ? B: I lost my banana . A: I think you can't miss it . C: Yeah . D: Yeah ? A: Okay . B: Uh . C: Yeah , I think it's cool . C: I think we can put a six here . D: We have the lightning , or The lighting . A: Yeah , we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow . C: So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or Yeah . A: It's okay . A: I think it's very easy to I would say seven . D: Yeah . D: Seven ? A: It's hard to miss it . B: Six . B: Yeah , okay . D: Is it is it robust ? A: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . B: Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . B: Yeah . C: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know Yeah , okay . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . B: Yeah . A: So maybe we can put a six . B: Yeah . C: Mm . B: Six or five . D: Everybody is okay , six . B: Five . A: Six is okay ? C: Six , yeah , for me . B: Six . D: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: S now um so . A: Tadada . A: We have to sum up everything . C: Twenty . D: Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . C: Thirty . C: Thir Okay . D: That's that's okay ? D: Six . A: Six is a good Yeah , the be . D: Good . D: Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think . C: Yeah , the top Mm . A: Okay , so six is a So it's a good evaluation , I think . C: So will become eight soon ? A: It's very promising . C: Yeah , well it's a bit biased . D: We have a good price and uh . A: Huh . B: Yeah . C: Okay . D: Good . A: So this prototype is quite nice . C: Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , uh quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Just a just a phone , wireless . B: Mm-hmm . A: So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . C: Yeah . A: I think the Yeah . B: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , it's much more complex , but Okay . A: So , I think , we can summarise . A: So we have seen the prototype . A: It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . A: The the the financial aspect were okay . A: We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . A: The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . A: So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . A: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . B: Start to eat banana . A: I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay so congratulation . B: Yeah . C: Congratulations to the team . A: Nice product . C: Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . A: Yeah . A: I think it was a good collaboration uh . A: Aspect . C: So what does the management say ? A: Sorry ? C: What does the management say ? A: I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . C: Ah . A: All it depends on who watch this meeting . B: Yeah . A: We don't know . C: Yeah . A: Okay , so good guys , so see you for next uh successful project . C: Okay . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Fruits . D: Mm 'kay . C: Mm .","summary":"The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components.

{"meeting_id":"IS1002b","dialogue":"A: So we are here to talk about functional design . A: Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . A: So here's an agenda . A: Uh I'll open . A: Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . A: Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . A: Um now you can all give your presentations . A: We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . A: Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . A: Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . A: Uh did you all receive that email ? B: Yep . D: Yeah . A: So does anyone have any overall Mm . D: Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . A: Mm . A: Yep . D: So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . A: Mm . D: And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . D: What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Right . A: Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . D: Yeah . D: No , I I agree with you . D: So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . A: Okay . D: So that's that's that was my reactions . A: Okay . A: Yeah . A: but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . D: Yeah yeah . A: So we're quite fixed . D: Yep . A: So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . D: Okay . C: Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . A: Yeah . A: Hmm . C: So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with . D: Yeah . D: Kay . D: That's right . A: Hmm . D: I think we take with you . C: So it's kind of a stupid decision . A: But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . B: Right . A: For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . A: Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . D: That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . A: Mm . D: Okay . D: Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . A: K yeah . D: So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . D: It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? D: What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . A: Mm 'kay . D: If we lose one we need to bring two or three . A: Okay . A: Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . A: Obviously the the w it has to be branded . C: So then the double R_ will be our our I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . A: Kay . A: On the product yeah . B: I think one of I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . A: Can you handle that black and yellow ? B: So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . B: You know we don't wanna a big clunker . A: Mm . B: We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so That's fine . D: So you have this ? A: Nah . A: So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . A: So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . A: That's Okay . C: Yes . B: Okay so so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . A: Mm it's enough . A: But uh click it on off ? B: And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . B: We need some kinda of power d power source . B: Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . B: Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . B: You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . B: And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . B: So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . B: Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . B: You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . B: So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . D: Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . B: I think any des No . D: We're talking about existing technology . B: Right I think Yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . D: Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . B: We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . D: Okay . D: Okay . A: Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? B: But Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . B: Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . A: Kay . B: So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . B: Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . A: Mm 'kay . A: Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? A: No . B: Uh I don't have any figures right now . A: Kay . B: We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . A: Yeah . D: N okay . B: Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . D: Mm . D: Mm the shell ? B: Yeah . B: Basically yeah . D: Okay . A: Okay . B: So yeah . B: That's all I have really . A: Okay . A: Thanks . A: And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . C: I Hey mouse . A: I can give you that to click on . C: Open . A: And you wanna get View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? C: When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . A: Just go up to view . C: Uh . B: Click , don't Yeah . A: Mm 'kay But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . C: This doesn't work . C: So yeah function design . C: Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . C: If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . C: Um something cute and small . C: The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . C: So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . C: And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . C: There's no need to have that in the remote . C: So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . C: Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the Yeah . A: So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . B: Mm-hmm . A: Because otherwise we're just going to I mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? B: Right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button . A: So it should be in there . B: I mean software-wise there's really no difference . A: Yeah . A: Okay . B: I think . A: Isn't Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . D: I have maybe a silly question . D: I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . D: I I don't understand how those two things are connected . D: How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? D: I don't understand that . A: So that might play on what we can do . C: Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet . B: Scheduling . B: Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . D: Okay . C: But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . B: I think I ha I agree . D: Yeah 'cause , yeah , I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . D: I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . C: Yeah , but it's not happen yet . B: Well for me Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Well you have digital T_V_ still already . D: So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . B: Unless you have a Yeah . A: Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . D: S Okay . B: Mm-hmm . A: A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . A: They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . A: So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . D: Okay . C: Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . C: That's the thing . C: And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so Well I dunno . B: I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . B: You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . A: Mm . B: I don't think . A: But still there there's an opportunity . A: If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . A: Mm . A: Okay . C: One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . B: I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . B: Just you know Right it's just not Yeah . D: Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . C: Yeah . D: I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I but I'm not a tech-mind either . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , and neither do I in fact . D: I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . A: Bu uh . A: I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . C: Yeah . D: We are selling it to an existing market . C: Yeah . A: Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . C: Yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . A: I dunno I'm Mm 'kay . D: That's Yeah , and and , yeah , and and we're also marketing a product . C: That's the problem . D: It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . D: So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . A: Mm . A: Yeah . D: So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? A: Hmm . A: So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . A: Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? C: Yeah . D: I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . D: I need to make it special with a high price tag . D: I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . A: Mm-hmm . D: I want I want to market it as exclusive . D: So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . A: But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . A: Does that make sense , huh ? D: No I no I I understand what you say , but what I'm what I'm , okay we probably need to move along , but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? A: Mm . A: Yeah we probably should . A: We we're doing alright for time . A: Yeah . D: So that's just my question , but we can keep talking . A: Okay . A: Sorry that kinda cut into you there . B: Well Right . C: No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . C: Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . C: Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um Yeah . B: I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . B: Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . B: They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . A: Mm . B: I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . A: So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . A: Is that Mm . B: I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . B: Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? B: Maybe five percent , you know , and how much Right . C: Yeah mm . A: But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . B: Yeah okay . A: Be a good idea . B: I'm sorry . A: Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . D: Yeah . B: Sorry boss . A: I'm not the boss . A: Okay . D: Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . D: You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated . D: I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but Is that for over here ? A: I think that's probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah . B: Yeah . D: Okay , alright . B: Well it's kinda both of us . B: Us us user interface . A: Is it ? D: That's 'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . A: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . D: So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this 's just something . B: Mm-hmm . B: I was thinking about that . B: Then your lights would go off , though . A: Mm . D: I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? D: What makes this thing attractive ? D: And it's only for televisions . D: So we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . D: And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . B: Yeah . D: At this price I don't see it yet . D: I'm I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . A: Hmm . C: But we th that should be design . D: Yeah . C: That should be the design basically . B: Right . C: I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it . C: We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . D: Okay . D: Have to do you have to do it in the box ? C: Yeah . D: Okay well , so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . C: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Maybe make it in the form of a gun . D: We can sell it in United States . A: I have a question uh for you . A: Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? A: In terms of making it work or the cost of that or Okay . B: I don't I think all these things are pretty standard . B: I think we'll be okay . A: Kay . A: Cheers . A: Onto participant four . D: Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do I go here ? D: Okay . B: Mm you can just click . D: Go go . D: Is that right ? B: No no no you just get off that . B: You just click anywhere . D: Ah-ha . D: Yeah , what for me is it um I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . D: I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . D: And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . C: Mm-hmm . D: That's what we decided here . D: Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . D: So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . D: We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . D: So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . D: So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . C: Mm-hmm . D: Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . D: Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . D: I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . D: I don't know . D: These are just thoughts . D: Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . D: So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product . D: Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . C: Mm-hmm . D: Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . D: If if we could have a technological something Mm p please . B: I have an idea . B: And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . A: Mm . B: Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . A: Yeah . B: Right ? B: And s for some people Yeah . D: Solar . B: Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? D: But solar Blah , I like it . B: Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . B: You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . B: And also you can I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . B: You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . D: I like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . B: It w it would increase the cost . D: But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . B: And you could page the remote if you lose it . B: Maybe there's a button on the cradle . D: Yep , that's right . D: I really see But the cost i No no . A: Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? D: No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . D: There's uh I mean I don't see it anyway . A: We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? D: Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys . D: I my reaction is no , but Well , see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . B: Well what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . D: You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . D: Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . D: Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . B: I I Yeah . D: Every home's got to have it . D: If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? D: Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too . D: I just don't have enough money right now . B: I just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . B: Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . B: And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . D: Yep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . A: Mm-hmm . D: Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . D: They say they say okay here you go . D: They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . D: I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay . A: Mm . D: And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? D: beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . A: Mm . D: I don't see it . B: I don I I d I have to disagree though . B: I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . B: It does what they need . B: These aren't I I think that it Right . A: And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . A: It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever . D: Right . B: Right . D: No I understand that . A: So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . A: All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . A: So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things . B: Mm-hmm . D: Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . C: Yeah y y you you wouldn't The interface will be different . D: They've identified this product limita That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . A: Oh okay okay . A: We have done this . D: If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . A: I see . A: Mm-hmm . D: And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just a television remote ? B: Right . B: Well here's Right . A: And I I'd Mm sorry . D: I don't . B: We he well here's my thing about that . B: If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . B: If it can't control if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . D: That's right . B: I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . D: I I I have a tendency to agree with you . D: I really do . A: So we really can't chase that . D: That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . D: I really question where we create the demand . B: So I think what we So that's what I'm saying Mm-hmm . A: We're really looking for something basic . A: The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . A: We're selling more than just the product . A: We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . A: We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . A: It's reliable . A: And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . A: So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing . B: I think that's big . D: W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . D: So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . C: Good design . A: We only have a few minutes left . D: But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . A: Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? D: Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . A: Okay . B: I think so , yeah . D: In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . A: Okay . D: And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . D: So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . D: We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . D: It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . A: Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . B: Yeah . A: If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . A: Yep we have five minutes left . A: Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . D: Or my d I mean I I well we g we're talking about the other end now . A: And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . B: What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? B: How do you feel about that ? B: Or how does everybody feel ? A: Well how does everybody feel ? A: I I think The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? D: I like it . D: I like the idea , but we have t we have to find out Well . B: No , but I that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end . A: And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . B: Mm-hmm . A: It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . B: Right . A: So it's very good for some people but it's not a like But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . B: Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . B: Yeah well it Mm-hmm . A: You have to l sort of remember . A: You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . D: Mm . A: But I I don't know , that's just my opinion . D: Well , I think again it's it we have a cost issue here . D: You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . D: Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? A: Mm . D: Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . D: I don't see it yet . A: Kay . A: So what do we think maybe we should Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? C: Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . D: W a question I have in in a 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . D: The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . A: Really need to wrap up now . D: Can can can we have multiple designs ? D: Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . D: I don't know what that creates cost , or Yep one over another . B: Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . D: Yeah , okay , I hear that . B: So Um but what we could do is some kind of well I mean Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . C: Yeah , complicated but Yeah . B: I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . A: Yeah . B: I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . B: Even though the cost may be low . D: What ab what ab what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ? D: Just an idea . B: Mm-hmm . D: Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . D: They're selling these things everywhere . D: Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone . B: Or what if it looks like a pen ? D: Doesn't matter , yeah . B: Yeah . D: I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . B: A pointer ? D: It That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . B: Yeah . D: I'll sell whatever you guys design . A: Mm . B: Yeah . D: I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . D: I give you ideas , you guys create the product . D: Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . D: Don't worry about it . D: I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . C: Okay . B: So just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . B: Um I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . A: Yeah . C: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . B: Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . A: I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . B: A lot of people As a watch ? D: No no . A: Yeah , there is remote control watches um , but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . B: Mm 'kay . C: Yeah they are not simple . A: Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . B: Mm-hmm . D: One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop ? B: That's what I was saying . D: Who's lost or broken their their remote . A: Gotta cut up . D: So how many remotes do they wanna buy ? D: Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? B: Exactly . A: Mm . C: Yeah . D: And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: How does this happen ? A: The last remote you'll ever buy . B: And also presumably they've Exactly . D: And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . A: Well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . B: Yeah . A: Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . B: True . B: Right . B: Yeah . B: The locator'll definitely be more expensive . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . A: We really need to finish up here . D: uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . A: But uh Yeah we have the the power-adaptor products . A: We sell power-adaptor products . A: So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology . D: It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . A: Yeah . D: So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . A: Yeah I think so , without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . D: A charging system . B: Right . D: If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . B: Right . B: I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . A: Okay . A: Yep . B: You know , something like that . A: Kay . A: Thanks guys . C: Yep . D: No that's not what I want , I want Oh look it here .","summary":"The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor. The group decided that they want to incorporate teletext despite the management's directive. The group does not want to include the battery charging stand. There was a lack of information about the cost of components and materials. The group felt constrained by the new project requirements and had difficulties implementing the management's directives.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting focused on functional design, the participants, including A leading the discussion, B the Industrial Designer, D the Marketing Specialist, and C, Pedro, the Designer, delved into the intricacies of creating a new remote control.

A: We may do . D: Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? A: I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy . C: Pro Probably not , 'cause he's 'S been listening to too much . D: So I believe I can fly . C: He's getting retarded . B: Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . C: Yay . C: Or not . B: Or not . C: Yeah . D: Just what I needed was something exciting . D: Remember , I'm an old man . A: Kay , ready to go ? B: All ready . A: Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . C: Apparently I'm old as well . A: Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . D: Thirty's really young , eh ? B: We do . A: Uh k exciting ideas . A: Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . A: Um I'm gonna open . A: I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . A: I'm gonna take some notes . A: We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . A: Yep . B: Alright . A: Well when I say hopefully , we have to . A: So I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . A: And does anyone really want to go first ? B: I guess I'll go first . A: You p two ? B: Yeah . A: What's Components design . B: Component , I think . B: Yeah . B: Yep that's it . C: Presented by name . B: My name is . D: Jose he man is . A: Your name is name ? B: My name is name . A: Huh hi name . C: My name is Inigo Montoya . C: You killed my father . B: Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush . C: Prepare to die . D: N name . B: So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . A: Right . B: Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate Yeah we've all broken a remote control . A: We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah . D: I've I just love you tech guys , huh . B: So you've also got um you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . B: Um Well so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . D: They just Yeah y do jabber . C: Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and Nah . A: You press this and it does th I dunno who and whatnot . B: Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot . B: So exactly . B: So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno . D: P Yeah . B: Uh it's two double A_ batteries . B: This is pretty standard remote . B: So here are options for our power sources . B: You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . B: I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it . A: Kay . C: I wanna change that . A: Okay . D: I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . D: Like this . B: Yeah . B: So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . D: And that's on the camera . D: Yeah . A: Kay . B: Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense . A: Mm 'kay . B: And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . A: Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? B: M battery versus cradle I think is yeah . A: Okay . C: I like the kinetic . A: So we have battery versus cradle It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , you could Mm . D: I g I I figured you would . B: It could be fun . D: Yes . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . B: So um our case design . A: Hmm . B: We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . B: Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . B: If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh Yeah pers I think wood i I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . A: Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . A: Nah . D: It it it Uh . A: Okay . A: Hmm . D: Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . D: We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . B: Right . B: And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . A: Okay . B: Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . A: Kay . A: Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? B: Yeah um Yeah . A: Yeah okay . D: And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . D: You don't even need to lean down to get it . B: The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . B: So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . A: Okay . B: I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . A: Okay . B: I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? B: I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces . A: Okay . B: I have no idea . A: I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what . D: Mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what I see . B: Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . D: Yeah that's what I see also . B: Alright that makes sense okay . B: Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels . D: Ooh . B: Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface . A: Okay . B: For electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . B: A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh Yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up ? A: D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? B: Previous previous , okay . B: A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . B: Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . A: Okay . A: Okay . B: So but yeah . A: Yeah that makes sense . B: That's the end of my presentation . A: So presentation from I guess design would go best . A: Next . A: Technical functions or interface concept ? B: I think No . C: Oh interface concept . A: Yeah that's it . C: Very long presentation . A: Yes , but it has your name on it . C: Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . C: Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . C: They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so . C: No . C: It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . B: If the T_V_ is working , yeah . B: That's just I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . B: So Well then why don't you just press the up button ? A: But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? A: So if you pressed it and went , up ? C: That kinda would r d yeah . A: Man yeah . C: That would kind of lose it . A: But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go Up . D: That's right . B: Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . B: It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still I don't think it's practical at all . A: Yeah , okay . B: I think it's a bad idea frankly . C: Yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . A: Okay . A: You guys know your stuff . C: Um as for the point that we making about losing it . C: Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , about But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . B: That I would believe . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Somehow . C: Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . C: Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . B: Mm-hmm . C: And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . A: So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? C: Ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone . B: That's not a scroll wheel . A: Nah . A: Oh okay okay . A: I see . B: Right . B: Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . A: Uh , okay . A: Okay . C: Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost . C: That be it . A: Kay . A: So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching ? D: I dunno . B: Trend watching has a later date there . D: Trend watching I guess . D: Trend watching I believe . A: forty six nineteen fifty seven . D: See what it looks like . A: Yep . D: It's been so long . D: Well I don't know what to say . D: When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . D: I see so many of 'em out there . D: There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . B: Are you talking about the picture ? D: Yeah yeah . B: That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . D: And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . A: Mm . D: That's what I understand so , hello . A: Upper management said yes . A: Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . D: And and so yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? D: Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . D: Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . D: What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? B: What's special and unique about a scroll ? D: Uh well I don't yeah it's I I just see it as different . A: It's cool . D: I don't say it's specially mm I don't say it's special . D: Uh I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . D: I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . D: I need something to market about this thing . D: We're we're a new firm . A: I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , but wi with a similar Mm . D: What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique . B: Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice um and also be really durable . D: Yep . D: Mm 'kay . D: Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . B: Right yeah . D: And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . A: Course . B: Yeah . D: Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . D: That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . A: Yeah 'cause that's . D: And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . D: Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . A: Mm . D: So I need a product . A: Mm 'kay . B: Well let's get a product then . D: I need a product to market . D: And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . D: Tha that I'm not concerned with . A: So now So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? D: If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . A: Do we go basic or do we go for features ? A: Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? B: Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? B: Function-wise , what does that do that Yeah . A: Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ? D: Yeah wh wh what's the wh Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . B: Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . A: Mm 'kay . C: But would we I dunno . D: So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . A: Yeah . D: If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . D: But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market . A: What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . B: Yeah . B: Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . A: So I d Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it . B: I don't think volume or do you think volume would be No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but Mm-hmm . C: I'll bet first in volume maybe . C: I dunno . A: We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . D: Mm-hmm . A: It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . D: Yeah yeah . D: I think it's that's right . D: I think so . A: And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . A: It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . D: Mm . A: So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh What type of casing ? D: Yep . D: I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . B: Yeah . A: I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . B: Mm-hmm . B: I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . A: Okay . A: Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for Okay . B: Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . A: So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? A: Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? C: It's only a T_V_ . C: Hmm . B: It receives no information . A: Okay . B: So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . B: Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . D: Yeah . D: Yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . B: Right . D: Don't see it . A: Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . A: So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? A: What what overall things have we not decided on ? B: Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . B: There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? B: What do you guys like in the user interface ? A: I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? D: Again . D: Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . D: Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . D: And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . D: You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? D: Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . D: It's just another it's just a an idea , and I don't know I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . B: Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed . B: Mm-hmm . D: This And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . B: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . A: Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? A: Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . D: Oh okay phew . B: Yeah . D: I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . D: I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . B: Well The The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will Um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . D: Mm-hmm . A: That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? C: No it's just different . B: But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . D: Integrated , yeah . B: Yeah . D: So it's just uh I I think that's I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control . B: It should be a really simple signal though so That's true yeah . A: And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . A: But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? B: Oh yeah yeah . A: It's Makes your living room more fresh as you watch . B: It'll be really cheap . D: Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . D: You can Yeah yeah yeah yeah . C: Maybe not . A: Okay we're doing well for time here . C: S Yeah . A: Um we've got about another ten minutes . A: I think that uh Mm pr my personal preference is out . B: So the scroll wheel , in or out ? A: I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . C: Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . A: Mm . D: Yeah . B: For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . B: I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . B: I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . A: But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . D: W Yeah . B: Sure . A: Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? A: You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to Mm . B: Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . D: Oh yeah . A: Uh I see I see . A: That's where you Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . D: Yeah . A: Okay . B: It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . B: It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . D: I I think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . D: Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j . A: Yeah if you're just sitting there going That's kinda cool actually . B: Yeah . D: I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . A: I like that . B: Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . B: Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . D: Well there's ano That's right . B: But Right . A: Well not n necessarily . A: You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . A: If you do that . B: Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . A: Other than click click click . A: Yeah . A: And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah I think so . A: Primarily . D: I I think so . C: Yep . D: Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma . D: But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . A: Mm-hmm . D: So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . D: I know what because it's on the television . D: The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . D: So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay ? D: So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? D: You understand what I'm saying ? B: I think I know what you might be getting at , or or Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it c it Why ? A: Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? D: Oh no we could read it from the television . A: And then it that basically Mm . A: Well that's quite cool . A: You'd need a display on the th the thing . B: It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . D: Yeah the the television can tell you . B: Yeah . D: Can . A: Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . A: Yeah that's kinda cool . A: How would you program it though ? B: Well you just it's one extra button . B: You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . D: Put And then . A: Okay okay . B: So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . A: Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah that's kinda cool . A: I like that . D: And again we have another another great marketing tool . D: We have about three we have three or four things here . A: That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . B: Mm-hmm . A: You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . D: I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . C: Yeah . D: This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services . A: Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . A: The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . B: Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . A: Making it last . D: Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . A: So if there's a button for each type . B: No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels . A: Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they Yeah yeah the mode switch . D: Ah-ha okay . D: Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . B: Right . B: I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ okay . A: Just the lights behind the buttons . A: You could have back-lit buttons maybe . A: Would that work ? C: Yeah . A: Is that okay we have five minutes . B: Okay . A: So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . A: We want a mode indicator . A: We want back-lit buttons . A: And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . A: I've seen some remotes do that . B: Okay . B: Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . B: It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . D: Yeah yeah . A: I think we are yeah . B: I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that . D: Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . A: Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price . D: Didn't you say so ? D: That's what I mean . D: We can increase the cost . A: Yeah . B: Okay . D: So I don't know I don't know whether having Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . A: Kay . B: I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . B: So Right . A: Yeah . A: So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . A: But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? A: Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . A: We're entering a new market here , so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? D: Okay I'm I'm okay with that . D: I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . B: Well y yeah . B: Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? D: We have to find cost . A: But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . B: I'm just asking you . A: I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think yeah I could probably afford this uh would I buy it ? B: If Then you could probably afford this . A: Maybe . A: If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . A: Then maybe you know . A: I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much 'Kay . B: Oh no no . B: I would say thirty five to forty . D: Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . A: Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . B: Okay . A: So the question is what we ca we make it for . D: Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . B: Right . A: Mm . D: It's one of the marketing features in this . A: That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . C: Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . D: Mm-hmm . B: With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . B: And it's gonna look sexy . C: Or not . B: Or not . B: It might look like clay . C: Okay so you can market pe depending on that ? D: Yeah yeah . D: Bas th that's that's easy . D: That's that's not a , it's a . D: Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . A: Yep . D: Under the title of uniquenesses . C: Cool . C: Hmm . A: Okay . A: The next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? A: It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . A: So we've got more than a thirty minutes . A: Um we've got more like fifty . D: Well I have Is my three twenty one is the next meeting ? A: The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . D: That's that's almost uh fifty minutes . A: Yeah that is . A: Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations . D: You guys can You guys you guys can uh create a All kinds of things . B: Probably . B: We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . D: Thanks , yeah . A: Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? B: Yeah . B: I don't think so . B: If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess . A: Okay . C: Yeah I think it pretty much everything's covered . A: Okay . A: This one was quite easy . C: Coulda been worse . D: Still . A: Always the optimist . C: Yes I am . A: Kay thanks guys . D: Thank you . D: I don't have any emails . D: This means I can go home . D: Oh , we all leave .","summary":"The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. He discussed energy source and material options, and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option. He displayed the three options for chips. The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group, and the group decided to not use it in their design. He suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability. He discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface, and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost. The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive. The group had a discussion to decide on the product features. They decided to include a charging stand, to use a thin rubber casing material, to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability. The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will construct the prototype.

C: Um yeah so what we ended up with . C: Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . B: Unit price . C: Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . A: Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? C: Yeah . B: Scrolling through your favourites list . A: Oh okay okay . C: Zapping you know zapping . A: Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . C: Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . C: And um yeah that was the result . A: Ah 'kay . A: I like the the the the logo on there as well . B: It's very prominent . A: It is very prominent . A: So this is the Okay . B: So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . B: Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . B: Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . B: This is the power button . B: Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? B: This is the teletext . C: Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah . B: The programme button , yeah the programme button . A: Ah , okay I see . B: So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . B: So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . B: So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it yeah . A: It's pretty cool . A: Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? C: Not helping . A: Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . B: Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . B: You can feel it . A: Mm . A: Feels good . A: I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . B: Yeah of course . B: Well this is clay . A: Yeah it's kinda cool . A: You have to reach a little bit don't you . B: Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . A: Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . B: These this is a bit larger than it would be , but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . A: It's cool . A: I'm impressed . C: Don't have no one to handle that . A: And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ? D: I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . D: Yeah I think it's good . D: Good good good job . C: Yeah . C: So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . B: Beep beep beep . D: Uh pla I'm ha It's great . C: The locator function . A: Okay . D: That's great . D: It's a great feature . B: Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up . A: Mm it's impressing . A: So let me get it , if I press this button I see . A: That's pretty cool . C: Wicked isn't it ? A: Hang on . D: So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town Uh , I can see that . B: Beep beep beep okay . A: I plan to do that as well . B: Um no no no tha that's alri Exactly that's exactly what those are for . A: So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? A: Ah okay okay . B: And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . A: Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ? B: And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm . A: But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . B: Right . B: So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ? D: Yep I like . D: Good job . A: So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? B: Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . D: No no . A: Okay . B: So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . A: The hmm . B: Careful . A: It came off . A: The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . D: Well I mean of course , I mean My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . A: Mm . D: You know some blend of silvers and blacks . B: Beep beep beep . A: Okay enough of that . A: Well i it's cool guys . A: Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? B: Yeah . C: Ja . A: Okay . A: Now now . D: So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . A: Have you ? A: Okay . D: Yeah yeah . D: So No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . A: Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? A: Oh I see I see . D: I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I've got this really strange cable . D: So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . D: Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? C: Nah . D: So what we had is we had the method . D: That's not how you spell method , is it ? B: No way . D: No A_ . D: So this doesn't go so fast this way . D: And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . D: And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . D: We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate Help me . D: The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . D: So the features I think we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . C: It fell off . B: Beep beep beep . D: Um the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . D: Uh and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . D: We're wanting to make a name for ourself . D: We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . D: One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? D: That was something I would be interested in . D: Um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . D: We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . D: Um w That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . A: Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm 'kay . D: But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . D: But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . D: The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . D: Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . D: But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . D: There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . A: And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? A: Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . D: Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? D: You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . A: Hmm . D: You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . C: W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . B: Mm-hmm . C: But uh Very co very colf colourful . D: Uh to me the only additions Yeah . A: Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . D: Yep . A: Mm there's a risk of that . D: But anyway that's uh Mm-hmm . A: Okay so we can talk about finance now . A: So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? B: Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . A: Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . B: Oh . A: Now I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . B: Uh-huh . B: Uh-huh . A: Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , uh an uh Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? B: Yeah . C: beep beep beep . B: Oh , sorry . B: Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . A: Okay . A: Yep . A: Okay . A: So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . B: And we and we have a single-curved uh Uh I think that It's single-curved , yeah . A: Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? A: We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur You think ? D: We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . D: I don't know whether that . A: Okay I'm convinced . A: But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? A: So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . B: See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . B: So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it . A: Well hang on . A: Do don't speak so it's in here , in that w do we have any we have special form don't we ? B: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Yeah we do . A: So that's yeah . B: Ah . A: But the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're O okay so we're Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? B: What do you know . B: Oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty If th . C: We don't It's a scroll . B: That's a scroll . A: Just a scroll ? A: It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? B: Uh no we just use it as a scroll . D: Ooh . A: Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . B: It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . A: It wasn't bad . C: Yes . C: We're wicked . B: Yeah . C: Awesome . A: Okay so we're on to the We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell How's it going ? B: S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . C: Yeah . A: Anyone got any thoughts ? B: What ? A: How how have we done today ? B: I think we did pretty well . C: Yeah . A: I think we did pretty well too . A: That looks pretty spectacular . D: No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . A: Any other chang uh thoughts ? A: Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? C: That was mm-hmm Yeah . A: Is it the . B: Sh I think there was plenty of room . A: I I think we we ended up being quite creative there . B: We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas . D: Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . A: Mm . C: No . B: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . A: Not every idea necessarily , it's still a remote control . C: Basically . D: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . A: Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? D: But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . A: No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . C: It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork . B: Yep . A: I agree . D: Cohesive yeah . A: Synergy . D: Yes synergistic yeah . B: There was a lot of synergy . A: Teamwork , yeah he is uh . D: Yeah . A: What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . B: These cables suck . A: Mm . A: Yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Mm-mm , lapel . C: Yeah . B: Yep . C: And that's D you must have very long shirts . B: Yeah . C: That's way far down lapel mic . A: Wha okay , oh , alright . C: Lapel lapel lapel . B: Lapel . C: That's almost a crotch mi cr Oh dear oh dear . A: That's it's down , it's quite close . D: You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta Oh . A: Keep it , keep it calm . A: Oh dear . A: No more pizza for me . A: So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . C: Cause this is you were using it o upside down . C: Still that Use them like that . B: That's our boss . A: Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . A: I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . B: Pedro's right . B: Pedro's right . A: I don't care . A: Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . A: What new ideas have we found ? B: Oh wel Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . A: Well let's do both then . A: Uh for the product ? A: Yeah we came up with quite a bit . C: Bunch of new ideas . A: And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more Yeah less sore on the ears . C: Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . D: Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . C: Mm . D: And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . D: It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but I don't think that's the that's avoidable . C: Coulda been worse . A: Okay so Are the costs within the budget ? C: Mm n no . D: No . A: Nope . A: Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . A: No requirements are changed . A: We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . A: And the costs within the budget ? A: Not the original budget , but they are now . A: Is the project evaluated ? A: Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says . C: Hooray . D: Okay . C: Free coke provided at the cafeteria . B: All right . A: Oh I don't know how that got there . A: Uh anyway . C: Who wrote that one ? A: Thank Thanks guys . D: So we need to close this meeting , yeah bravo . D: Congratulations . C: Cool . B: Good job guys . D: S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay . A: Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . A: Oh .","summary":"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components. They demonstrated how the locator function operates. They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria. He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros. The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project. The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed many of the initial specifications. They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment. They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget. The group was satisfied enough with the prototype and the final production cost to continue with the current prototype. The Marketing Expert was still concerned that the remote would only be used for televisions. The group felt that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed the initial specifications. The group had difficulties with their computers and much of the meeting-room equipment.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to delve into the detailed design of their new product.

{"meeting_id":"IS1003a","dialogue":"A: So we can start ? D: Yeah . A: Suppose I have to do my presentation . C: Ah okay . A: Eh um So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . C: It's Ada Longmund ? A: So um we will have to um speak about m the project . A: Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . A: Record . A: So the project method is the following . A: So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . A: Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . A: Uh . A: The tool training is to try out the white board , so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics . D: Mm-hmm . C: Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , yeah ? D: So right now ? A: I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later . B: So yeah I think you can do it . C: Yeah , I don't know . A: So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . B: Twenty five Euros ? D: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: I think it's quite good price , yeah . C: I it's it's reasonable , s quite yeah . D: It's reasonable , I think , yeah . C: Twenty five . A: And uh it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . C: Is Yeah . A: So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . A: Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . A: And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . A: And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . C: I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ? D: Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . B: Yep . A: Yeah . D: AMI and okay . A: I_D_ , yeah . B: Yeah . A: So So I will manage all all the group . D: Okay . C: And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , yeah ? B: That's me . D: Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me . C: AMI yeah project . C: you will be the manager yeah . D: You can manage all this , yeah . B: Okay . D: Good . A: So you have questions ? D: Um . D: Not really . A: So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . B: Yeah . D: So which you , the Industrial Designer . B: No I'm user interf I'm user interface design . C: I am the Industrial Design , yeah I am the Industrial Designer so . D: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . A: And you ? A: Mm okay . B: Okay . D: Yeah . B: So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design ? A: Hmm . D: I mean , you have to know . D: Ah , you have to know it . C: It's difficult . D: It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is . C: You know very soon . B: Yeah , I think so . C: So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . D: Mm . A: I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . B: Okay , so I make uh u user interface . D: Yeah . B: You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it . A: And i maybe you will transform it . B: Make make yeah . B: Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . C: Yeah . C: So the materi Okay right . B: I design the user f user interface , you design the function . A: Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . B: Yeah . D: Okay . B: Okay . C: But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . B: Yeah yeah . C: But I don't know . C: Okay . D: Well . D: You know . C: I'm the industrial designer . D: Oh , okay , okay . D: Not the other one . C: So . B: Okay . C: Okay . C: So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay . D: Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . A: And yeah . A: And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . B: Okay . A: So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . B: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . B: Yeah . A: You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: And not too expensive . B: Yeah . B: And uh simple . A: As we want to maximise the benefit . B: And easy to use . D: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so . A: Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . B: Ah , yeah . D: That's the problem . C: It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know . B: Okay . B: Okay . A: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . B: Okay . A: So , is it okay ? D: Mm . B: Yeah . D: It's clear . D: Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal . C: Is it ? C: Are we supposed to do right now ? B: Yeah yeah , you try . B: Try first . C: Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . A: So you think we have to do it now ? B: You can draw something which is very simple . C: Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it , so . A: You want me to draw something ? A: Product manager okay , let's go , I will try . B: Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . B: Kemy is really good at drawing . D: Many Yeah . C: It's not matter So . B: You're going to draw ? B: Okay . D: Uh it's the same as mine . C: yeah . C: It's a It's a cat . B: What's this ? B: It's a fat cat . C: It is not a fat cat . D: It's the fat cat , okay . C: Yeah , it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . B: Can you draw uh um rabbit ? B: Oh , hat ha rat . D: A rat ? B: Yeah . D: That's difficult . A: No . A: A mouse is not too difficult . C: It's your rat . A: Mouse is okay . B: Yeah , it's okay . D: Yeah . D: Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard . C: Okay , go right , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea , so It's a rabbit . B: Mm . D: Jus Yeah . B: Okay . B: Oh . B: Okay , I draw . B: The only thing I can draw is like this . B: Oh . B: Oh . B: Oh . D: A duck . B: No . B: What's this ? A: You love the eyes . A: Yeah , that was the eyes . B: Okay .

{"meeting_id":"IS1003b","dialogue":"C: So , I will open our functional design meeting . A: Mm-hmm . C: So , I will play role of the secretary . C: As also Program Ma Manager . C: So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um What's your talk ? B: Industrial Design . A: Marketing Expert . D: Okay . C: Marketing Experts . A: Mm . C: And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . C: Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . D: Okay . C: Um , so you're participant two ? B: One one . D: No no no . C: No you're No , I'm participant one . D: One . B: Three three , it's three sorry . D: I I think I'm a . C: Okay , never mind . A: Okay . C: Kay , did you save your presentation ? D: In one . B: In one , sorry . A: Yeah . C: Isn't that technical functions ? A: No sure . B: So you didn't save it maybe . D: It's mine . A: Uh it's David Jordan . B: Alright , so David Jordan ? C: Name's Jordan . A: Course . C: So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation . D: Mm yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: No , no . A: Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . C: Uh . B: Too great for email then . D: Okay , so . D: The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . B: Yeah . D: Uh I I will focus on user interface design . D: Um so move to the next slide . C: Mm . D: As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . D: There's a lot of functions . D: Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . D: So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? D: Um , let's move to next slide . D: Um . D: Yeah . D: So I so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . D: A very good example is Google . D: As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . D: Um so move to next s slide . D: So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . D: So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . C: So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . D: Uh With sophisticated functions , but with very yeah powerful . C: So powerful , many functions and very easy to use . D: Yes . D: Yep . A: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah . B: To merge the two system huh . D: Yeah . C: You mean this one ? A: Yeah . C: Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . B: Mm yep . B: But But this is Yeah . D: But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . A: Yeah , and then Yeah . B: Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . C: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? B: Yeah , yeah . B: For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . A: Oh it should okay , yeah . B: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that So . A: The user should know . C: Yeah um such as maybe the Go on , go back and So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . B: Yeah . B: So . B: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . A: Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . D: Yeah , that's my job . B: That's your job It you Okay , okay . D: That's my job . D: It's not the easiest I've got to . D: Yep . C: Okay . A: Okay . D: Powerful and easy to use . A: So that's the point . D: Yeah , that's the point . C: So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . C: So you you're Um . B: Participant two . B: Yeah . C: Okay . B: The rationale must be design , or So we can move to the next slide . C: So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . C: Okay . B: As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . B: So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . C: Mm-hmm . B: So , this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser , so . A: Mm . A: True . C: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? C: Twelve , nearly thirteen , yeah . A: What the cost is ? C: The cost Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see . A: Twelve , twelve a half . B: Yeah . B: You can move to the next slide , so . B: So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . A: That might just So . B: You can go to the next slide . C: Okay . B: I have some kind of pictures you know , here . B: You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . C: Yeah . C: What is this ? B: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . C: Okay . B: Look . B: But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . C: Okay . B: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . B: Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . C: Okay . B: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? A: Okay . A: What's the average price of this technology then ? B: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . B: Or at least you know , the You'd yes , you can . D: So what , the wireless remote control ? D: There's a wire with remote control ? B: It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . B: We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . B: We can have both also . D: Okay . C: So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . D: Okay . D: Okay . C: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah , but Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? A: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , but in a sense The wire ? D: Wireless remote control . B: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , sometime I want to have wire because you know . C: I'm just asking you . C: Do you think it will be cheaper ? B: Uh , I don't think it will be too much . D: Okay . C: Could you answer please ? B: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . C: Okay . C: Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . D: Mm-hmm . C: As it's yeah . A: Yeah . A: True . B: Okay , yeah . C: I think it's more your problem . C: Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . D: Mm-hmm . A: Uh that's my job . A: That's the Now the Yeah . C: Okay , I'm sorry . C: So So just think of um the usability . B: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . B: If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . D: Okay . B: Right , so . D: Design a wireless remote control . C: Yeah . C: Just think of the problem . C: If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? D: Yeah . C: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , yeah . A: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? A: True . A: This you will see in my presentation then . C: So I will let you to do your presentation , so . A: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Which is participant four . A: So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . A: We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . A: Sorry for the functional recurrence . A: So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . A: We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . A: Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe . C: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? B: The look , how it look like . C: Okay . A: Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . A: So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . B: Yeah . A: So it's it's interesting information , I think . A: And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . A: So we should change this as well . A: And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . A: And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . A: And uh this is one of the main point for me . A: But I'll come back to it later . A: Kay . A: Could you go next slide ? A: Uh , so as you said uh , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . C: Mm-hmm . A: So this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . A: Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . A: And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . C: What is R_S_I_ ? A: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . B: Yeah . C: Ah um okay . A: Okay ? A: So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . A: So last slide . A: Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . A: If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . B: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . A: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more . D: Functions . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: So Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the manual . C: Mm okay . C: And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? D: Yeah . C: Sure ? D: Yeah , I think possible . C: Yeah ? D: Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button . C: Yeah . D: So lets you then you have less buttons . C: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? D: But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu , so you can well for example Yeah , I think so . C: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . C: Yeah , I think the Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . B: The manuals . A: It's Yeah . D: Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . D: Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . C: Yeah , okay . C: Okay , but Yeah , but Mm-hmm . D: Then you you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions . D: Yeah . D: For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . B: With a Look fancy . D: So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . D: So we can has less buttons . D: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . B: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . D: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . D: You know . A: Yeah , this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step , yeah . D: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . B: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah , yeah , maybe . C: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . A: Specially distribution , yeah . B: Yeah , maybe . C: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . A: Uh Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so . D: Yeah , personalised colour . D: Because you know Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control . C: Yeah , it will cost little bit more . B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: And also f Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . D: Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so . A: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros . C: So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . D: Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . C: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . D: Mm-hmm . C: So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , hmm . D: Yeah . C: So , is it okay for your presentation ? C: Nothing else to to add ? A: Yeah , it's done , just yeah . A: If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Mm so So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . A: So . C: So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . D: Mm-hmm . A: Lame , or Mm-hmm Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . C: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . B: Yep . D: Control . D: Mm-hmm . C: It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . D: Mm . C: We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . C: Is it okay ? D: Okay . D: But there's balance between function and the cost . C: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . D: Yeah . D: Okay . C: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . D: Mm-hmm . C: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . D: Mm-hm . A: Mm-hmm . C: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay . B: So . A: So has to be yellow . B: Yellow . C: As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . D: Okay . C: Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . D: Mm-hmm . C: Require lot of requirements , but Yeah . D: Yeah . B: For cheap remote control , yeah . D: And cheap . D: A low cost . C: Yeah . C: But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . B: This is Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . A: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . C: Maybe not , but mayb So . A: It's maybe more in browsing . D: Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . A: Yeah . D: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . B: Okay . D: Ok It's It's not so uh popular now . A: Hm-mm . B: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . D: Mm . B: You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage , so if people don't have the technology . D: Global , okay . A: Mm-hmm . C: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? D: So I I so As as for the colour , what what do you think ? C: I think it has to be yellow . B: Yellow ? C: Yeah . B: Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? D: Yellow ? D: T_V_ remote control ? A: Min Yeah . C: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . D: Okay . D: Okay . B: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . C: Why you go It has to be fashion . B: Or should be . B: Yeah , so . B: Doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just mm . D: Okay . C: So you have to Yeah . C: It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . C: Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . C: Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . D: Okay , okay . D: Okay . C: And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . D: Mm . C: It's okay ? A: Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . C: Yeah . A: And that's it . C: Yeah . B: But I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . A: It's already changed for Mm-hmm . C: I think it would be simpler . C: Okay . C: So I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . C: And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . C: Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . B: Industrial Designer , yeah . A: Industrial Designer . B: Component component , yeah . D: Okay . C: And Florent to work my subject . A: Yep . C: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . A: Okay . C: It's okay ? A: Yeah . C: I think the um session is closed . B: Good . C: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . B: Okay Okay , that's clear . D: Okay . C: Not in mine . D: Okay .

A: So , we'll S technical accessoire ? C: Yeah . C: No no no . A: Interface ? C: Yeah . A: This . C: Mm . C: So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . C: Um there's three concepts in the user interface . C: So first one it's a Google controller . C: The second is a fancy controller . C: The last one is uh intelligent controller . C: So there are three concepts in our controller . C: Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . C: Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . C: So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . C: Uh this is a first concept of our controller . C: The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um attractive . D: Mm . B: Mm . B: A nice one . C: Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . A: I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive .

C: Yeah . A: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Mm . C: So the last uh concept is intelligent . C: We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . B: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . C: Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user . A: Okay . C: Okay . A: Something else ? C: No . C: There this is the three concepts of our controller . B: Yeah . A: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , so Y Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . A: Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? A: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? B: Yeah . A: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . B: Maybe . A: You don't think so ? A: Yeah , sure . C: For example , if you cannot find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . A: I That's true . B: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . B: One and Yep . A: Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . A: You have a mute remote controller . C: Yeah . D: Mm . C: So you can use your gesture . C: That's no problem . D: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? A: Broken arm ? C: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very Yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay . A: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? A: Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? D: But this this but this would never happen anyway . C: Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time . A: Why ? D: Yeah Yeah , but the Yeah but this Yeah . A: If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so . B: Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the That's right . C: Yeah , it's very interesting . C: Yeah . D: I don't think it Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . A: Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . A: You're not you're not obliged to share it . A: Yeah , we can yeah . C: Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . C: Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it's c come to channel three , I don't have to It's advantage . D: No . B: It's it's And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers , eh . D: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . A: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , but one other question . A: How how much will it cost ? B: No , more expensive maybe . C: How much ? A: Yeah . A: Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . C: No no we we d we we just are use um No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . D: Uh if you if if you use the basic But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . A: Some some efficient . A: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? A: Or ? C: Yeah , I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very it's uh yeah . A: Yeah , but uh uh Mm-mm . C: It's No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . D: Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . B: Well y y you have also the language problem , you know when you 'Cause it it have to be universal , so . A: Yeah . A: I agree with uh Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international remote control . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: We need something that is international . A: Suppose we're we want to sell it in France . C: Yeah . A: The recognition system will be able to understand French . A: If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , so . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . D: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or Yeah . B: Yeah but you know . B: The product The pro It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . C: It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . C: It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . A: Mm , okay . C: Yeah , it's Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . A: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? B: But Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . A: Yeah , but how will you Oh . C: So Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Mm . B: If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . C: Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . B: Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , because uh the for example for Se Oh really ? C: Yeah . C: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to No , it's not so complex . B: That's Comple A microphone maybe . D: Yeah , but then w Yeah , we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem . A: Seems to be quite complex . A: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? A: And where will be they ? A: Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? C: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . C: It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . A: Yeah , but where is the controller ? D: Okay . C: Where is the controller ? A: Yeah . C: It's in your family , in your home . D: No , but then it's it's like this uh Yeah . A: Yeah , but we're here it's uh an object . A: But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . C: Yeah . C: Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . A: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . A: If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . B: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . A: You just want to interact with television . C: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command and you do s your gesture . B: I if you say one , he switch to channel , yeah . A: Yeah , but you can lose it . C: No no it's n y if you lose it Yeah . B: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . A: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . B: Devic Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . C: Yeah . A: Ah . D: But you would still have the buttons . D: Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? D: Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? C: I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . D: Okay , so you yeah . A: Yeah , but Mm . C: You can see they can switch form one modality to another . D: Yeah , I dunno . D: It's a bit risky risky . B: Yeah . A: I think so . C: No , that's quite inter quite attractive . A: And maybe it will be quite Okay . B: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y Yeah but i i Yeah , we should . C: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . D: Yeah , I dunno . C: We should have confidence in technology . B: Uh . A: Hmm . A: So , what do you think ? A: We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . B: Mm . D: What ? A: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? D: If if I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . C: More features , yeah . D: But if if if it like doubles uh no one would would be interested . B: Yeah , but I think he need a control that is very reliable , so . A: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . A: Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? A: Hmm ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . C: Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts . A: You think it's possible ? C: So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? C: There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: No , I mean Y No , but you need you need new remote controller then . C: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . B: It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . B: But uh I think a user need Don't have a the the Yeah if we can send email from it . C: You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , but Okay . D: Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , or No . C: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . D: No . B: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if Yeah And for all the person of the family maybe , so , yeah . D: Cause for example yeah . C: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , but uh we want so Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . D: Yeah , you wou you would True . C: That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , uh Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? A: You don't need to tune it . A: Yeah , why not ? D: I mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . A: If it's Not too expensive too . B: Because you have new Ye Okay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . D: Google is is simple , works fine , so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . D: Uh thi this I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . C: The then nn no . C: Tha But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . D: See That's the problem , yeah . C: That's the same yeah . D: I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . C: Yeah . D: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so . C: Yeah . A: Okay . D: I mean , that's the point . A: So let's go to the Industrial Designer . C: Okay . A: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so . B: Okay . C: Yeah . A: Two ? B: Yeah , participant two um Yeah , working design , so . A: Working ? B: So I think Can you go to the next one ? A: I can Okay . B: I uh it's not this one . B: It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design . B: Sorry . B: Component design . A: It's okay Uh I think there's something wrong with your Maybe you you record it somewhere else . B: So this yeah so this is the described use What ? B: Are you inst I don't think so . C: It did didn't r receive it . C: Didn't receive it . C: Participant one . C: Participant one . A: Interface concept . A: No . D: Hmm . A: Mm mm . B: Oh . B: Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer . D: Yeah . A: Uh . D: Dunno . A: Nope . B: Okay , okay . B: Yes . A: It seems that we have a problem with the Yeah , so No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh Yeah . D: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or I think it's more interesting what he says , okay . B: I can say it to you without . C: Yeah , maybe we can first come to uh to Frahan . C: With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later . B: Yeah , exac Okay . A: You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , true . B: Yeah . C: Okay . B: In fact , I don't know , I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control . A: So . A: Okay . A: Okay , never mind . C: Okay . C: Okay . B: So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so . C: Okay . B: So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . A: Mm-hmm . B: So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . C: Okay . B: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . C: Uh-huh . B: And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah mm . B: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so hmm . A: So . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: And what tha what about the uh materials ? B: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , or you know , you can have some Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting . A: Impersonal , mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: Special for Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . A: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm . B: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . A: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . A: And you think that we will be Okay . B: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , so . A: So wood . A: And what about the buttons ? B: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . A: No it's fashion , yeah . D: What about the touch scr touch screen ? D: For example . D: It's it's expensive I I guess . B: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . D: Mm . B: But And it is a kind of other design , I mean . B: It can also be interesting to have this kind of Mm . D: Yeah . C: So you got email ? A: I dunno . A: I think we have only uh five minutes left . D: Okay . A: Participant four ? A: Functional requirements ? D: Uh no , trend watching . D: The other one . A: This one ? D: Yeah . D: Uh , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . D: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . D: Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . D: They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . D: Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . C: Mm . A: Okay . D: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . D: So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . D: Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay . D: Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . B: Ah yes . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Okay , yeah . D: Cause it's it's really what people want . D: Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . D: And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . D: Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . D: Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . B: Okay . D: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . B: And fruit and vegetables yeah . D: And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . B: Spongy 'Kay . B: Okay , yeah , yeah . D: I dunno . B: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? D: Yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh device , so um Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . B: Pla S Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Okay . A: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . A: So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract pro-ecology consumers . B: Yeah . B: Solar . D: Yeah , so when I think it's Mm-hmm . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: It will be a Yeah . A: Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . B: Yeah , I think Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Case . C: Later ? A: So you think case . A: Something spongy . A: Someth no wood . B: No wood but Plastic ? D: Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . B: Would some I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . C: Pla Uh yes . A: Maybe you It's it's natural . D: Yeah , maybe the base . B: It depends on the design we want , so . D: But still y Yeah . B: Yeah , it's natural and i And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol Mm , yeah , it's not right , so . A: Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood . D: Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . A: But it's still fashion . D: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno . B: Okay . A: Yeah , something that you can into it . D: Yeah . A: Uh and what about the user interface concept ? B: Google and and fancy , f how about the the voice ? A: Google and fancy ? A: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . B: And Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: The smart controller . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . A: Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . B: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . A: That's true . D: Yeah d I dunno . C: Okay . A: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . C: Mm . C: Yeah . C: It's good . A: And L_C_D_ buttons . B: Yeah , L_C_D_ . A: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . B: And pf what can we think a supplement to I think the supplement can be the voice . D: What interface ? A: Yeah , for the interface something added value . B: It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of Yeah , yeah . A: With a module ? A: You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . B: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Mm-hmm . B: To push button , yeah , yeah . B: Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . A: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . B: Yeah , turning yeah , yeah . B: Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . A: So , adding some vocal commands . B: Yeah . A: Simple ones ? B: Yeah , simple ones for expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new Yeah . A: Okay . A: So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . A: So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . C: Yeah . C: Yep . C: Yeah . A: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . A: And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . D: Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . A: Yeah . B: Okay , fruits . A: Yeah . D: If possible . B: Okay . A: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . B: Need it to be , okay . A: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . C: Yeah . C: Okay . B: Okay . C: Yep Okay . A: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . B: Okay . A: So , no more questions , we can close the session . D: Hmm . B: Sounds good , mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Okay , cool .","summary":"The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote.

{"meeting_id":"IS1003d","dialogue":"B: Mm-hmm . B: So , ready ? D: No not really . C: Kay . D: Just Crap . B: Sorry , I I um I'm afraid Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . D: Okay . C: It's perfect . A: Your judgement it's is biased . D: Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? A: So , we are So let's go for our detailed design meeting . C: Where ? C: It's here . B: Okay . D: Yep . A: So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba . C: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Kay . A: So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . A: And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . A: So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . C: I have slides . B: Okay . A: Oops . C: Ah , that is three . B: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . C: Product prod Yep . D: What slides ? C: Okay . C: Okay . C: So , this is our product or prototype . C: This is made by clay . A: Looks strange . C: Yeah . C: Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . C: Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . A: Okay . C: So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . C: And the shape , there's two basic shape . C: The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . C: It's we call it a mushroom design . B: Okay . C: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . B: Yeah . B: Uh Yeah , yeah I'm sure . C: So this is a introduction of our product . C: Next a mo Okay , yeah , so next slide . A: Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking . D: Yeah . C: So there are several key features of our pr prototype . C: The first is that it is fuzzy . C: I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . A: Oh . A: Maybe , I hope so . C: Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . B: Yeah , that's true . C: Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . C: In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . C: So it's quite convenient for user to use it . A: Chan Yeah , okay , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . C: Yeah , s okay . C: Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . C: Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . C: So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . C: You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so Yeah , everything's mushroom . A: Everything's mushroom . B: Yeah . A: So we can call our remote control the mushroom . C: Mush Mushroom design , yeah . B: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d To integrate , you know yeah . C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . B: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . B: You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in Really ? C: Yeah . A: Oh . D: Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . D: I mean there was fruits yeah . A: Fruits and vegetables . B: But Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know uh Mushroom ? A: Vegetables . D: Yeah . A: Mushroom is a vegetable . D: I don't think it is . C: Yeah . A: It's vegetable . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Oh , uh I'm not sure . A: So th it's something eatable . B: We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . C: Yeah . B: I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . B: This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . D: No , I mean , yeah yeah . D: Inspira inspiration is True . B: And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so . C: Yeah . B: And so So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and You know , we don't need to k . A: Next slide . C: Uh , no this our only two slides . C: Yeah . C: So we cut it to see . A: Mm-hmm . B: You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i The battery it is under . C: Okay . C: So where's the battery battery ? B: It is in th in in the base , yeah . A: In the base . C: Base . A: In the basement . C: Here ? A: In the basement . A: And where is the solar solar cell ? D: But we say uh we sa we said solar . A: Where is the solar cell ? B: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so , but it it's might be okay , so . A: Oh . A: Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? C: Okay . A: Okay , we'll see after . A: We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? B: I it might be okay . C: Okay . B: So Yeah . D: Yeah . D: I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , and first one was uh fancy look and feel . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . D: Uh just let me check . B: So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . D: One one being true , and seven being false . D: Okay . B: Oops . D: Ouch . D: So Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? C: Okay . C: Yeah , I think so . B: I think you have nice colours . B: I don't The sha the bowl shape people like . D: But is it Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . C: Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour So it depend on how d do you define fancy . B: Is it really fancy ? B: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . D: Yeah . A: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that It would be bet more like a lemon ? B: Do Don't do that , please . D: I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious . B: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so Yeah . D: If I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah . B: Because i Less button . A: Yeah . C: Uh so , my mush . A: Looks like more fruit . B: Yeah , but you don't have any button now . C: Mm . A: Maybe a pineapple ? D: I dunno . A: And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? C: Yeah . C: Hmm . B: That's uh yeah , is that that's a good idea . D: Yeah , it's getting Okay . B: So that's great . A: It looks more like a pineapple . B: That's great . A: Sorry . A: What's the use for that ? C: Uh , for turn turn the ball . B: I have no idea , so . C: If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . B: I have no idea what If it is fancy or not . A: And where is the voice recognition ? C: Uh . C: Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . D: Yeah , that's Wait th that's the second point . A: Okay . C: Th this th th there's two two functions . C: This is microphone array Okay . D: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . A: Okay . A: Is it better like that ? D: I mean No , the colour is okay , that's fine . B: So we can we can say t The colour , is the colour acceptable ? A: Looks okay , let's say it's a pineapple now . B: So the shape now . D: I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red . A: It looks like a now you took it . B: It's too much red ? D: Um if Right . B: In the basement ? A: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . D: So , from one to seven ? A: Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum ? B: I will give I will I'll gi I'll give two or three . D: No , seven is false and one is true . B: Three , it's okay . A: Three , I will say three . B: Three , three . D: Three ? B: Three is fine for me . D: Okay . C: Kay . D: Three . A: Isn't it bitter like that ? C: Yeah yeah yeah . D: Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . B: What other Is it easy to use ? A: Feasible ? B: Ye uh Embedded . A: You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an Oh . C: Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . B: It's a micro array , okay . C: There four microphone . A: Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? C: So they they they they there's a microphone array . C: Yeah , yeah . C: So you can capture voice yeah , you c Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . A: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? B: Oh yeah , yeah . B: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is I W Yeah , but I see , you have microphone array embedded . D: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . C: Yeah . A: We have tactile buttons . D: Mm-hmm . B: You have That's good . D: No , that's good . D: Yeah . B: And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . A: Oh , yeah . D: Yeah , th that's another really good point . B: Yeah . D: Maybe okay . B: I think technically it's acceptable , so Yeah . A: Maybe two ? D: So using the same scale , two ? A: Two ? B: Two , yeah , two . A: I would say two . B: It's it's fine , so . A: You agree ? D: Okay . C: Yeah , I agree . A: It's better like that , isn't it ? D: Now maybe the most critical one . A: Okay . B: Most Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . D: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? B: But it's just speaking . C: Yeah , it's very easy . B: You just need the command . D: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please . C: You can use this in this way . B: As a principle . C: Yeah . C: Th this is the base . D: Yeah . C: So you can turn to change the channel . D: Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? C: You just tu turn d d Yeah . B: I think maybe if you he If you hear some click Yeah , it would Oh yeah , that's difficult . D: Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? A: Oh , ok I understand . A: You take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? C: Yeah . A: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . C: Yeah . D: How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? B: That's dif that's difficult . C: No , no , no . C: I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah but y how you need to know I I think something that Yeah . D: I agree . D: I agree . D: But I mean if you're fro from two ? C: So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . A: Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on . C: So change . C: Yeah . B: And you you can I think you can if you have a scale , so Yeah , it's a bit difficult . D: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh We're not talking Yeah . A: Oh yeah . C: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . C: So you got how many degree you you it No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? D: So you you count one degree , two degrees , no . C: You can do it . D: I don't think so . C: I think so I think so you can do it . C: I think so , you can just change . B: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . B: You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah . D: Yeah voc vocal command is okay . D: But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing , ah . C: There's uh also a number , you know . A: Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . A: So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . A: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? B: To see uh yeah uh Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Seems to be good . C: Yeah . A: Good choice , mister David Jordan . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , I mean you're famous . B: And but I'd It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . C: And also you can , if you i You ca you can turn this . D: You . A: yeah , what's what's this cherry ? C: Or you ca you can you can also turn this . C: For this you can tune it's for tune . C: You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . C: If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . D: Mm . C: It's like fine , from coarse to fine . C: This is coarse , this is fine . B: Yeah , yeah yeah . B: That's that's very technologic , so . A: Okay . C: So it's coarse to fine design . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Okay the uh th this looks better . D: Yeah . C: Yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . B: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the Uh it's k on off , yeah . C: This is from one channel to Yeah . A: Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: On off . D: Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . A: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control . B: Yeah , sleeping . A: That's true . A: W that why we have the solar ti yeah . D: Solar . B: To compensate . B: Yeah . C: Okay . A: So three . D: So , which number ? B: Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . C: Mm-hmm . A: Do you agree ? C: Yeah , agree , agree . A: Three ? D: So reasonably , is four , is one ? B: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . D: So , three . B: Four or three . B: Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . A: And what's your opinion ? D: Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . B: Will you give four ? B: Five ? D: I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . D: I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know . B: Yeah , so maybe if Yeah but y you know You just push two button , zero and and one . C: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? D: Yeah . C: I think it's easier than traditional controller . C: If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . C: There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . D: So you have yeah . C: But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? D: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . C: Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . B: And that's Are there some buttons ? D: Yeah . B: Okay . C: Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . D: Mm-hmm . A: It's not what you said previously . A: Previously you said that turning this was the fine Fine to coarse . D: Yeah , if you're changing your mind . D: Fine to coarse . C: Yeah , yeah . A: And from ten to ten channels here . C: Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . C: Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . A: Okay . C: Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Mm-hmm . D: Okay . D: But this this has to stay on the table , right ? D: This has to stay on the table . C: I i this is just a base . B: In fact on a flat place You can Oh ye yes , that's right . C: You can just Yeah . D: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just It's Yeah . A: Oh Yeah , no no , no . A: You can't put it out . A: It's just your turning from the base . A: You need to have everything in hand . A: If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . A: It's impossible . A: You need to put it on and turn . D: You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand . B: Oh my God . C: You use your y So th this is a d next generation controller . A: Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . A: Nobody would take it . D: Sure . D: Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . A: So nobody w will lost lose it . B: yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou Four . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Okay okay , okay . A: S maybe we can change from th Four ? B: Maybe four , it's okay . C: Four . C: Okay . B: I'll put four . A: Easy to use , four . A: Gonna say four . D: Four . B: Yeah , four it's more reasonable . D: Uh it's even easier to maybe . B: You can you can erase with this er yeah . D: Ok Mm . C: Okay . B: Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . B: So it's nine , nine over three . D: So , average ? D: Three ? C: Three ? A: Trois . A: Three . B: Oh yeah , it's . C: Trois . D: Okay , so Yeah , especially on the easy to use target . B: It need maybe some wo further work , but it's Yeah , uh s yeah . C: Yeah . B: Might it might be fine . A: So , th the project is accepted ? D: Okay . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , b I think Yeah , yeah . A: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . C: Okay . A: So uh mm mm . B: That's the finance . A: Mm . A: Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . A: So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . B: Yeah . C: Mm . C: Okay . A: So we need to calculate the production cost . D: Mm-hmm . A: As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . B: Oh yeah . C: Yeah . A: So , just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet , so so it has the energy source . A: We have hand dynamo . A: No , we don't use that . D: No . A: We have battery , right ? B: Yeah , we have battery . A: Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . B: No , um solar cells , yeah . A: Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? A: Do you think one would be enough , or such as as number of branches ? B: Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . A: Three ? B: Three three solar cells . A: So , electronic . A: Single simple chip on print ? A: Just one would be necessary ? B: S s simple , simple , yeah . A: One ? B: Yeah . A: Zero for the others . A: And sample sensor , sample speaker . A: One ? B: Mm . B: One maybe , yeah . A: As we have voice recognition , I think . B: Yeah yeah yeah . A: So the case . B: Is it Is sh it Wooden . D: So we are all already nineteen . A: Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . C: The solar cell is too expensive . D: Yeah . B: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . A: Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? A: Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . A: I think it's more like double curved . D: That's gonna be double curved , yeah . B: Double curve , yeah , double curve . A: One ? B: One , you have . A: Uh wood ? B: But it's yeah , a a rubber uh Yeah , yeah . D: Rather four buttons . D: Oh no , interface . A: Uh do we need special colour ? A: Y maybe , two ? D: Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . A: We have two special colours . B: Y y yeah , yeah . A: Push button . C: Mm . C: Yeah , we have four . B: Five ? C: Five . A: Okay . A: Scroll wheel . C: No . A: We don no . A: It it's more like integrated scor . B: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . C: No no . D: Yeah tha that's wheel . B: Y you tu you turn you turn it , so Yeah , true . C: No no no , it Okay . A: Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Okay , yeah , yeah . B: Scr L_C_ display , maybe . A: So , no button supplements ? D: I think the price is okay . C: No . A: Okay . D: Um , no . A: Okay we I think we have problem . B: Interface . A: I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? B: It's okay . B: fine . D: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . D: Yeah . A: Has it changed . B: Yeah , it was stage one , so . D: No y i it did change , but just imagine we have Yeah . A: Okay . C: We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . B: So I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . C: Oh . C: We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . A: Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ? D: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah . C: Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . A: Okay . C: Advanced version we have speak . B: Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . D: Yeah , if Yeah . A: Or it would be better . C: Plastic is free . A: So , do we need special colour ? D: Yeah , that's one of the requirement . A: Because we have red . B: Yeah , red and yellow . C: Wait . A: Red and yellow . D: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . B: Fancy . C: We we can we can we c yellow . D: Black then is a regular colour , so . A: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee . D: Yeah , one . D: Yeah . D: So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . A: Yeah . A: An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . A: And I think this is one . D: Yeah , thi this might be . A: Integrated scroll wheel push button . A: So we'll we have only one ? A: And push button . D: Close to . A: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh Something flat . B: One . B: I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . D: Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? C: How about we change the sale ? D: Double curved . B: Double curve . B: We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . B: F some Single curve . D: Yeah , but flat Case , what's the ca And then one Euro left . A: S uncurved . A: Yeah , maybe not . A: Yeah . B: Single curve should be fine , so . B: Oh , what It's it's a bad idea , so . A: Mm . C: Ah we have one Okay . A: Nearly . D: Um . A: Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . D: Um So we have one button , one wheel . A: I think there's a problem with the push push button . A: We only need maybe just one . B: Two ? B: One . A: Just one . A: Yeah . B: That's fine . C: Okay . B: That's fine . C: Agree . A: So yeah , you will have So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . B: One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it's fine . B: It I th it's fine . A: So So , yeah . D: It's good they're not charging anything for that . A: It think we we've done good job , as the cost is twelve fifty e Yeah , but it's under or equal . C: Cou could we have look Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? D: Yeah y actually it's wrong . D: We're not under twelve Euros and a half . A: It's not written . B: It's fine . A: Sometimes it's under or equal . B: It's under or equal . D: Okay . B: It's fine , so It's fine , twelve fifty uh The solar cells , r is i is it ? D: Okay . C: Okay . C: So let's say Wha what yeah . A: Twelve fifty . C: Which part is the most expensive part ? D: Solar cells . A: Yeah , I think . C: Yeah , I think it's not t t Cheaper . A: I think , yeah . A: But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . B: Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . D: Yeah . D: That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve . B: Yeah , with mi It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . D: Yeah . B: Maybe if uh okay . C: Okay . B: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah but we just have one button . A: So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . D: Easy . D: I don't know about powerful . D: Yeah . B: It's easy to use . A: Easy , powerful . B: It's very easy to use . D: Mm . A: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . B: No . D: Uh that's what we've just done . B: We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Um okay . A: So Now So So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? B: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? D: Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno . B: Okay , okay , it's fine . C: Yes . C: Of course . C: This is my job . A: Yeah ? A: Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? C: Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . B: Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . B: And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for . C: Yeah . A: And for the marketing guy ? D: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . B: Yep . D: Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . C: Okay . B: Okay , okay . A: And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . B: Yellow . B: I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . B: It can be an interesting I don't know Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon . A: Yes , just lemon . C: Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . B: It's flat , uh Yeah , that's right . A: Squared ? C: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? B: It's really boring , yeah . B: Yeah . C: So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can Yeah . A: Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . B: Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually . C: Yeah . C: Because the T_V_ you also Yeah . A: Oh , that's interesting . A: You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . B: Device devi The fruit ? A: Electronic device . D: Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . A: Maybe Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . B: Yeah , it's But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . D: Maybe two years it's dead . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Mm . D: Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . B: Yeah . D: T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . B: Yeah , yeah . D: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for fifteen years Yeah , yeah . B: That's a yeah , yeah . B: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . A: Customable T_V_ . B: Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep Yeah , you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons , the fashions uh We int Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A: Ah such yeah . A: You've already said mobile phones . D: Tha that would that would make it . C: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , and following Mm . C: Yeah . A: It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr So I think the costs are within the budget . C: Yeah . B: A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's So what i and do w is it Okay . C: Yeah . A: We're just at twelve fifty Euros . B: Yeah , the pr at Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object . C: Yep . D: Yeah . A: So do you think you can celebrate your creation ? C: And you can celebrate your leadership . A: Oh , thanks a lot . A: Thank you , mister David Jordan . B: So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . C: Yeah . D: Hmm . D: Yeah . D: It's party party remote control . B: Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah . A: The thing now is to to sell it . C: Yeah , it's your job . B: Yeah , right , go and sell it . C: Sell it . B: Goo and good luck , so It should be fine . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve Twenty five Euros , yeah . D: Uh-huh . D: Twenty five Euros . D: Yeah , I think it's It's cheap , yeah . C: Twenty five Euros . A: It's maybe a little bit expensive . D: No , I I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . C: No , it's not so expensive . B: Wh really ? B: It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . C: Okay . B: S I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so It's perfect , and I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ Okay yeah , yeah . A: Maybe what you can do a test . D: Yeah . A: Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . C: Okay . A: But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . D: No , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah . D: True . D: Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . A: Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . D: Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had . D: It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . A: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . D: Yeah . A: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . D: Mm . D: Yeah . B: That's actually good idea , so It's not a mushroom . C: Mm . A: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too . C: So we have to give a So we have give him give it a cute name . D: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . A: Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . C: Mush mushroom controller . A: It's a pineapple now , it has changed . D: It's not the trend . B: It's a pineapple remote controls . A: It's a pineapple . C: Pa Pine apple . A: Pineapple . B: Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . D: Yeah , but just flying saucer , or I would say flying saucer . A: With cherry on top . C: Okay . B: Oh , that Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so That's that's pineapple remote control . D: It's more appropriate , somehow . C: Okay . C: Okay . B: I think it's fine . D: Mm . C: Okay . A: Will you buy one ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah I will try I'll try . A: Try to . C: Twenty five Euro . A: Okay uh One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . B: I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage Yeah I always lose my Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be I think I would choose this one because of the colour . C: Okay . C: Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one . C: Okay . D: Mm . C: Traditional one ? C: Yeah . C: So this one and this one . C: What do you choose ? A: I prefer the laser remote control . C: What do you choose ? A: No . B: It's it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . C: Okay . C: Okay . B: Yeah . A: Oh . A: Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . B: Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . D: Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . A: Yeah . D: We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . A: I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . D: Yeah , afterwards , if if it's a new trend . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Okay . A: So Champagne , mister Baba . B: Yeah that's that fine . B: So we can celebrate now . B: That's our new product . D: We should celebrate . B: Yes . B: It's it's fine . B: It's I like it . C: So buy one . B: Next time . B: Well , I'll buy one here . C: Yeah . A: So Okay , I will close this . D: Mm . A: Mm . B: Yeah . B: No ? A: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product . B: Okay . B: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Our final prototype which yeah . B: Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . A: Final prototype , right . C: Prototype , yeah . A: So , thank you very much . C: Okay . B: Okay . C: Okay . B: Okay . A: Very productive . C: Okay . C: Thanks . B: S so who is going to take the remote control ?","summary":"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. The team decided that the prototype required further work. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product. *NA* The remote will be shaped like a pineapple. The remote will be made of plastic. The case of the remote will be single curved. The remote will have one solar cell. The remote will have a scroll wheel. The remote will feature only one push button. The corporate logo will need to be incorporated into the product. Whether to use a mushroom or another fruit or vegetable as the basis of the shape of the remote. Having a base on the remote which the user is required to turn in a circular motion in order to change the channel.","enhanced_summary":"The meeting was convened to finalize the design and evaluation of a unique remote control prototype. The participants included David Jordan, the User Interface Designer, and Baba, the Industrial Designer, with A acting as the secretary.

A: So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . A: Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . A: Um you are the Okay . B: I'm uh Michael . B: I'm the user interface designer . D: Hi I'm Guillermo . D: I'm the Marketing Expert . C: And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . A: Okay , very good . A: Thanks for being here . A: Um so let's have a look to the the agenda . A: So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . A: Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . A: So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . A: Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . A: As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . A: It is in three step as you know . A: First the functional design . A: The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . A: During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . A: So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . A: So who want to start ? B: Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . A: Mister . B: Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . B: Let's see . B: Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um uh I think I have one in mind , so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . A: You have one in mind ? B: The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . B: Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . B: There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . B: And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . B: So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . B: So , that's my animal . A: Okay . A: Th thank you . A: Very interesting . A: Guillermo you want to ? D: kay I dunno why , but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther , or maybe yes . C: But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? D: Uh yeah yeah . C: So bad I don't like it . A: It would be very funny for us . A: Oh . D: Okay it's a friendly panther . B: Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . D: Yeah maybe . D: Um . D: Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so but I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh I dunno . D: I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . A: Okay . A: Thank you . D: Okay . A: Hemant . C: Um sure . B: So you don't like pink panthers ? D: I like it . C: Oh yeah . C: Thanks . C: This lapel is coming out once in a while . C: It's not very strong . C: Okay . C: So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . C: I'll try to draw elephant . C: It's a problem . C: Okay , thanks . C: Okay so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet . C: I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . C: And then we have it's trunk . C: And yep something like this . C: An eye , cute . C: Yeah , so and sometimes they have a hump . A: Poor elephant . C: It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . C: So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . C: When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . C: That's the way they walk . C: And that's very peculiar about them . C: None of the other animals walk like this . C: And they are very useful to human beings . C: At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . C: And they are found in um usually the warm countries . C: And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . C: That's what I know about them . C: So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . B: So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? C: There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . C: So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . C: And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there ? A: Yes . A: We have to I have to catch you , sorry . C: Wind up ? C: Okay , some other time . A: We have to to go through the meeting . B: Okay . C: Thank you . A: Thank you . B: We can discuss that off-line . A: Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . C: Thanks . A: So so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . A: So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay . A: And we should target the inter an international market . B: So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? B: So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? A: O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it . B: Okay , alright . A: So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . A: Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? A: Should it be a universal one ? A: And uh etcetera . A: So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . B: Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , so it's Yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah . C: Marketing person . C: Mm-hmm . A: So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . A: So we need to close the meeting . A: Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . A: So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? D: Yeah . A: Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . A: Thanks for coming today . B: Okay . C: Thanks . A: Thanks . B: Alright .","summary":"The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting.

A: You have a good reason for that ? B: Yes . A: Very good . A: Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . A: So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . A: Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . A: So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics . A: I goin I'm going to share with you . A: And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . C: Yep . A: You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? C: Yeah . C: Yep . A: The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . B: Mm . A: Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . A: But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . A: So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . A: Any ideas ? C: Mm-hmm . B: Uh the Powerstick . A: Powerstick , yeah . A: What else ? A: What else ? D: Uh . B: Maybe a Spanish name would work well . D: Mm I was thinking of the Mando . B: Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . B: Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . B: Mando . B: What is that ? A: Mango ? A: Mango ? D: Mando . A: Mando . A: M_A_ ? A: M_A_ ? D: A_N_ yeah D_O . A: M_ D_O_ . A: Mm , okay . D: It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control . A: What does it mean ? A: Oh . B: What does it mean in Spanish ? B: Control . A: Hmm . B: Okay . A: Nice . B: Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando . D: But mm , yeah . D: Mando sounds Latino . A: Okay . A: So , let's go for Mando ? A: Yeah ? C: Yeah , yeah . A: No objection ? B: Yeah that's . A: Great . B: And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , do you ? A: So Okay , I think this is Okay . B: So Yeah . C: Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . C: So we should be careful . A: Okay , I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . D: But yeah it uh Yeah because if the product will be international Maybe maybe I should uh start . B: Marketing . A: Something that should be addressed later . A: We should we should go to other for the other topics . B: Well that's the thing . B: We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a Um . A: Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . A: So let's go for the three presentations right now . A: So , who want to start ? A: So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Mm . D: Okay . A: Okay so I have your slides somewhere ? D: Yeah . D: Should be in participant four . A: Participant four . D: Yeah , yeah . A: This one ? D: Uh . A: S that's coming . A: Uh okay . B: Yeah . C: Yep . A: Great . D: Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . A: Mm-hmm . D: For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . D: I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . D: And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . D: There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and Yeah . A: Okay . A: Sh next slide ? A: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . D: So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . D: Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . D: So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . D: They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost . A: Mm-hmm . D: And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . A: Okay . D: So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . D: Liklier or more likely ? B: More likely . D: likely . D: Okay . D: Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . D: Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . D: So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . B: Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . B: So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market . D: Yeah . D: I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . C: Well maybe it could be a universal design . D: Sorry ? C: A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . D: Yeah . B: Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? C: Yeah ? C: That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? D: Yeah . D: Sorry ? C: The first and the third point , they are clashing . B: Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Okay . D: Like uh Yeah , like No no I was thinking of so like something yeah . B: Uh . C: So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . B: Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? C: Little sleek , longer ? C: And it should fit the hand . A: Something with the shape of the palm ? C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . B: Some finger grips maybe . D: Yeah . B: You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , but Yeah . A: On the sides . D: Yeah yeah . D: It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . C: Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . D: Not anymore . D: That's what yeah . A: And then finally Yeah . D: And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . A: First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . D: But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . A: We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ . B: Yeah . A: Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . B: No . A: No , so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . A: Um they want also uh Excellent . D: Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls . A: So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . A: So Yeah yeah . B: I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , but um yeah . A: Sure sure . A: So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . B: Yep . B: Okay . A: Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco Sorry , what is your ? B: Yeah . B: I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the Uh participant three . B: You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . D: Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah . B: Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off . D: Yeah uh channel fifty . D: Yeah . C: No it could be command control kind of thing . C: It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . C: Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . B: Yeah . C: Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . B: Yeah . C: So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . B: Mm . B: Yeah . C: It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . C: Otherwise it's just lying idle . A: Okay Michael . B: Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or Mm . A: Sorry ? A: Um yeah . B: Thanks . B: Okay . A: The wheel doesn't work . B: Great . B: Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . B: So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . B: There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . A: Looks like a P_D_A_ ? B: So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . B: Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . B: But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . B: And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . C: Change the channels . C: Yeah . B: Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . B: Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . C: Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . B: I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . C: Yeah yeah . B: So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . B: Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . A: Mm-hmm . B: One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . B: If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . B: So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . B: So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . B: So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . B: So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . B: It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . B: And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . B: So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . C: But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . B: So Yeah well we w Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . A: Mm-hmm . C: Because the same button is doing too many things . B: Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um I I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . C: Mm-hmm . B: They don't really do anything . B: Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . B: Um Well I guess that depends on how you market it . D: H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If y I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . C: It does sampling out of the . B: If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . A: Okay , can you continue , please Mi ? B: So , but yep . B: Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . B: So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . B: Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . B: I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well . A: Mm-hmm . B: And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . B: Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . B: You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . B: Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay , thanks . C: Yep . A: you want to go ? C: So yeah . C: So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I yeah , it should be . A: This one ? A: Great . A: No , not that one . A: you are two . C: Two . A: Alright . C: Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . C: So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . C: So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . A: Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . C: That's right . C: So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . A: Okay . C: These could be other kind of interfaces . C: Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . C: So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . C: So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . A: Mm-hmm . C: Otherwise we are just like others in the market . C: So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . C: So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . C: Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . C: And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . A: Yeah . A: That increases the the cost also . C: Uh that's right . C: But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . A: Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ? C: Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . A: Okay . C: Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc That's right . A: Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . B: Hmm . C: No it it could be little d yeah it could be That's right . A: So it could be s a few centimetres . B: Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . C: That's right . A: Yeah . B: So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for Yeah . C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . C: So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . A: Okay . A: Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . C: Yeah , that's right . C: Yeah . C: So we can That's right . A: This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . C: Yep . A: Okay , next . C: Yep . A: Uh that finished ? C: No no . C: Components . A: No ? A: Components ? C: Yeah . C: So , will you go to the next slide ? A: Yes sure . C: Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . C: We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . C: And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . C: So we could not put that . C: So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . C: So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . C: And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . A: Okay . C: So this is the easiest design the there could be . C: So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . C: To have different technologies . C: So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . B: You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . C: So these are the slight problems . A: Okay . A: So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? C: Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea , but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the Mm-hmm . B: Actually I'm not so sure because I'm the you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . D: I'm sure . B: You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . A: Yeah . A: Okay so Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . D: Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . B: Well it depends if it's a remote control th Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . B: If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Alright . A: Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . A: We are targeting T_V_ . A: We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . A: Um we have or good shape , yes . D: With a good shape for the Yeah . A: We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . A: Maybe this is something we can stick to it . A: And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . A: So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . A: Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . A: Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . B: Well it depends though well it depends . B: If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . B: Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . B: So that's an extra cost . A: Yeah that's right . A: Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use ? B: Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . B: Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? A: Yeah . B: Cause that really makes a big difference . B: Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . B: It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . A: Yeah . B: It's it's not really gonna For twenty five Euro ? A: That's good point . A: What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? A: Yeah . C: It's not possible . B: I think it's impossible . C: It's impossible . B: But but I dunno , I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . B: So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price . D: Uh What would be Wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? A: So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah because yeah . A: Okay , so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is They have tele teletext . B: Well th 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . D: What what kind of information ? D: Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the the n Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . A: Well , because they have teletext on it . A: Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . A: They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . D: Yeah . A: So to to uh to browse more easily the teletext . B: You can get a lot more information on it . A: For instance through uh through your remote control . D: So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? B: So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . A: The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh o Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . B: You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . D: Okay . C: Are But just a small thing , what kind of market we are targeting ? B: They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . B: There's dependi it also depends on the country . A: Well because for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the T_V_ . A: We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . B: No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . B: So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . A: So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to Okay . D: But Yeah . B: Uh . B: Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . B: I dunno . B: We need to find that out . A: We need to close the meeting . A: Um so Very quickly . C: Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? C: So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . C: That is very important . A: No . B: Mm . B: If it's a really small T_V_ maybe . A: Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . C: Broke . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: So this is that we z that that we should target . A: So the com the um the uh the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . C: Mm-hmm . A: The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . A: It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . A: So Yeah , but not sure . D: I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ . C: It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . A: Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no Okay this is this is an open question for you . D: Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . D: You need a internet connection . D: You need m more things . D: But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . B: Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . D: You just say channel fifty , and that's it . D: But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , it's To move to another target ? C: Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right . B: Well this is what we need to find out . B: Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? B: Cause otherwise we need It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though . A: Yeah . A: This is uh up to you to tell us . A: But I'm definitely not keen on to to no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . A: I'm not confident enough . A: I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . A: I uh that work It's real yeah . A: How to guarantee such performances is really hard . D: the expert uh said ninety five percent . A: Well this is still is is very bad . A: So , this is the end of this discussion . A: Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . A: Um so you have to work on the component uh concept . C: Okay . A: Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . A: Okay . A: So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . A: Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . A: Thanks . B: Yep . A: Bye .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. He suggests they name the project and they come up with \"mando\", meaning \"control\" in Spanish. The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents. He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. The industrial designer will work on the component concept. The interface specialist will work on the user interface. The marketing expert will work on trend-watching. The remote control will be for television only. The remote control should be fancy, a good shape, and not too small or too big. To target towards young people will bring in new technology. A wheel should be used to navigate. Because of budget restrictions, they cannot do speech recognition technologies. Corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product. They have not yet decided whether to include an LCD screen. Although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection, others are pushing for it. They find that the budget is restricting their capabilities, and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the second meeting, the team gathered to discuss the functional design of a new remote control project. The participants included Michael, the Industrial Designer, and the Marketing Expert, who shared insights on the design and market preferences. The meeting delved into deciding between a universal or specific remote control, with a focus on individual actions for each team member. They named the project \"Mando\" after a lively discussion on potential names. Demonstrations included a sleek design with a scroll wheel and considerations for speech recognition technology and LCD screens. Decisions were made to forego speech recognition due to cost concerns and to keep the LCD screen option open for further discussion. Action items included working on component concepts, user interface designs, and trend analysis for the next meeting. The team aimed to target the replacement remote market with a stylish yet affordable product, with a price point of \u20ac25 being a crucial constraint. The meeting concluded with a commitment to explore the LCD screen option further in the upcoming sessions.","relevance":0.459576726,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the project name decided during the meeting?","answer":"The project name decided during the meeting was 'Mando' after a discussion on potential names."},{"question":"Why was the decision made to forego speech recognition technology?","answer":"The decision to forego speech recognition technology was made due to cost concerns and uncertainty about the product's performance guarantee."},{"question":"What were the action items assigned for the next meeting?","answer":"The action items assigned for the next meeting included working on component concepts, user interface designs, and trend analysis."},{"question":"What market segment was the team targeting with the new remote control project?","answer":"The team aimed to target the replacement remote market with a stylish yet affordable product, with a price point of \u20ac25 being a crucial constraint."}]}

A: So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . A: So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ? D: Okay , . A: So marketing . A: So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? D: Yep . A: So you're four ? D: Four , yeah . A: Which is trend watch . A: Okay . A: Mr Marketing Experts . D: Yeah that's me . A: So Mm-hmm . D: Uh . D: Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . D: Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah ? D: Okay . D: Okay . D: Well wha what I found um can you Yeah . A: Next slide ? A: Yeah . D: Thank you . D: What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . D: After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . D: So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . A: Okay . D: Uh also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . A: Mm . D: And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . D: Spongy means eponge ? C: Mm-hmm . D: So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? B: What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? B: What you mean clothe No , I missed that one . C: Spongy means it it's like sp But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? D: Yeah , I I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . B: Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . D: No no , not not yet , not yet . D: Yeah , yeah . B: So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of ? D: So te textu textures , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Vegetable textures and all this kind . A: Drawings of bananas . D: Uh yeah , yeah . A: Uh-huh . A: Well so this is in the next slide certainly . D: Uh no no , it's not . A: It's not ? D: It's And Um . D: I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . C: Mm-hmm . D: But yeah it it depends on the Yeah maybe the shape the shape No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . A: So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . B: Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . C: Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . A: Apple for channel one . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but For instance , yeah . D: African or as an elephant ? C: That we can discuss afterwards . B: But okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . A: Okay . D: Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . D: I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . B: To fruit ? B: But is it uh is fruit cool ? D: What ? A: That's a question . D: What ? B: Is fruit cool ? D: Yeah ? D: Uh Is the new trend of the No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some Yeah . B: Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . B: Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . D: Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? B: Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber . C: Banana . C: Mm-hmm . B: I dunno . D: Or m Maybe . A: Maybe too long . B: Maybe . B: Too green . B: So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . A: A banana . D: Um Yeah . B: It's , it The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . C: I don't th it will be rolling a lot . D: Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? A: Okay . A: Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . B: Yeah . A: Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . B: Well , this is Okay . D: I think Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh more things . A: So So you you you suggest to go f Okay . A: S so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . D: It's not so simple . D: For instance , yeah . D: Yeah for for for given an an example yeah . A: Okay good . A: So maybe you can go ahead ? D: Yeah no , it's what I already said . A: Okay . A: Thanks . A: Um . A: Okay , I'll give the floor . A: So you are User Interface guy . A: So you're three ? B: Yeah . A: And it's this one . B: Yep . A: Go for it . B: Yep . B: Okay . B: So . B: S next uh slide . B: Okay . B: So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . C: But it's just a speaker right ? B: It's no , what it is , it's it's very It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . C: It's not a microphone . C: Mm-hmm . C: Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . B: Sample sensor sample speaker . B: It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . C: Okay . B: So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: But basically the thing is , we have this technology available in-house . C: In-house . B: So , um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . A: I there's something that I unclear really understanding . A: Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? B: You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? A: And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? B: Yeah . B: So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . A: Yeah yeah . A: So this is not s really to do to to do control . B: Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh Completely pointless yeah . A: Yeah . A: This is just more like a poi pois yeah . A: Yeah yeah . A: So it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . D: Yeah but you can u Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . A: Okay . B: Well yeah , that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . A: Yeah yeah . A: So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . C: Mm-hmm . B: So Yeah , that would be some development work . A: So this is out of discussion . B: Yeah . A: So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm banana-bando , yeah . D: M Mando . B: Banana-mando . D: Banana-mando yeah . B: Banana-man I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so Um , yeah . A: Uh then it could be cool yeah . C: Yeah okay , let's go ahead . A: Okay . A: Okay . B: So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . A: It doesn't look like a banana at all . A: Yeah . A: But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to Yeah . D: Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . B: But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . C: Stable thing , that's right . C: To have , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . A: Mm . C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . D: What's a turbo button ? B: Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . D: It con it controls the speed ? B: Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . B: So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . C: Mm-hmm . B: You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ? A: It's enough . C: Mm-hmm . B: I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . A: Switch on . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: So sounds crazy . D: I like crazy ideas . B: That's why you're a marketing guru . A: Okay . D: Yeah , of course . A: So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . B: Well , that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ? A: I think that No we can we can't use that . B: Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . D: I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . D: You we can ? A: We can't use that to to comman co communicate , it's just a thing No . D: We can't . C: Communicate . D: Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . C: It's one way . D: No ? B: But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize Mm . D: It's not a lot one hundred templates , it's not Ah , it's designed for a cof okay . C: Mm-hmm . B: Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . A: Yeah . D: Is it design for a coffee machine ? B: Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . D: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: A good good good thing . B: But uh Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . A: You want to g to move to your slides ? C: Yeah , that's right , yeah . A: You're finished ? A: Yeah I think so . B: But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . A: Mm-hmm . B: It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . B: Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping It's speech It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah yeah . A: Mm . A: Exactly yeah . C: So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: That's right . A: Oh , good idea . A: Very good . A: Okay , let's move on . A: So you're two ? C: That's right . A: Okay . C: So this is going to be about the component design . A: Mm-hmm . C: So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . C: So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . C: Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t Yeah . B: I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . A: Yeah . C: So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . C: The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . C: Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . B: So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? B: You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ? C: Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . C: So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . C: So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . B: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . C: So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . B: Okay . C: These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . C: So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's Wooden cases Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . A: Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be Yeah but the components inside . B: Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside . B: Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . A: Yeah . A: Very too expensive to do . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . A: And also uh Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . B: That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? D: Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . A: Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah ? A: Yes it is . D: Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh This it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . C: Is it an e apple which has Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . B: It's like a pumpkin or Green . A: Yeah ? A: Pumpkin . D: Green . A: Green . A: Um um um , yes I see . B: What does it taste like ? D: And you put in the salad . A: Pep pepperoni . D: Um Oui c'est ca Pepper . B: Ah yeah , is it what's it in French ? A: Poivron . B: Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . A: Uh pepper . B: Yeah . A: But um they do d Yeah . D: And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No , I mean in a I'm sure it's fun . B: I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like like with a banana you can have Well But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that , but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? A: Yeah . A: It's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun ? A: You think that young people that are Yeah . A: More than a banana ? D: But banana is not so handy , I think that's handier . A: Yeah . A: It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . A: Okay let's move on . D: Yeah you're right . A: So time is running , let's move on . C: Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . C: These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . A: Okay . C: Yeah , we can go to the next slide . C: Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . C: So we can have regular chip for control . C: Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . C: And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . C: It could be a beep kind of thing . C: Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . B: Okay . B: Okay . B: So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? C: That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . C: It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . B: Okay . B: Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . C: Mm-hmm . C: Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . B: Yeah . C: As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that That's right . B: Yeah . B: So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . C: Okay . C: Yeah . C: So these these were the component selection and these things . C: We can go to the next slide . C: And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . B: Although , if It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . C: Mm . C: Of fruits . C: Mm-hmm . B: Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . C: Remotes objects , okay . A: S objects . A: Crazy objects . D: I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . B: Well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . D: No but I think just one fruit to control everything . B: Like a power fruit . D: A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit . C: And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote . B: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . B: Well I think that's a pretty handy feature . A: Okay , good . C: So you're having a basis station . C: Okay . C: Your usually your remote sits on that . C: So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . C: Now let's say Basis station is with the thing . D: So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . A: Bu it's it's . A: You s you you thing . C: It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . C: So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . C: So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . C: Uh Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . D: Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . B: So Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . C: Uh this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . A: Mm-hmm . C: That's right . C: But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . C: So component cost is going to be the least . C: Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . C: So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . B: Okay . C: And Mm-hmm . B: I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? B: You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . B: And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . B: For better want of a better word you know ? A: You think that yellow it's kitsch . B: Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop Well they Yeah , like this colour this colour Maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana . A: If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . D: Yeah . D: No , I I Maybe li like that . C: A yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . A: O otherwise Roughly . C: It's neither a banana nor a And uh going to the last slide . B: No , exactly . B: Exactly . B: Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . B: I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Let's move on . A: Uh uh yeah . A: Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . B: Okay . A: Go for it . C: Okay . A: Well no , not not you , you can finish your slides before Mm okay . C: Okay . C: Okay , so . C: Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . C: So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . A: Okay . C: That's it . A: That's all ? C: Yep . A: Okay , so mm so well done for the presentations . A: So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . A: So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , I do I don't remember you call it ? B: Yeah . B: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . C: That's right . C: The basis station . A: Basis station , yeah . C: That's right . A: Uh so um so we're going for a stylish banana shape . B: Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . A: Yeah , right . B: So you know , so if you have like Okay , so So okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . D: What about what about this shape ? D: More or less . A: We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . C: There's less space on this to put with the buttons . D: Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ? A: If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . C: Uh what about a The base station . A: So ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward . A: So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . A: Yeah . A: So we have this . A: We have a a basis um , how do you call it ? A: A base station . C: Right . A: We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . C: That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . A: We need b R_F_ to beep . B: Okay , so it's uh Yeah . A: So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . C: Basis station . A: Basis station , thank you . C: Yeah , yeah . B: Alright , so we need uh okay . A: Can you go quickly please ? B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , so you have Yes . C: Turbo button . A: Yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here . A: And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . B: Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . A: And and you have two wheels . B: So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . A: Okay right . A: Good . B: And , uh No L_C_D_ . A: So no L_C_D_ . A: Okay great . A: Um . A: Very good . C: Okay . B: Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . A: Yeah . C: Uh for the remote ? B: Yeah . A: Oh , just the switch , no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . C: Remotes don't have power on off switch . B: Yeah . A: Uh so you On the side . C: Okay . C: S no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , yeah . D: What a What about Four millions ? B: Where ? C: Means on the remote . C: Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . B: Okay . C: They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . B: Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know . C: Oh , yeah . C: That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . B: Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? C: But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . B: I can't remember , what was Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? C: Twenty five . C: Twelve point five is the profit on one . A: Twenty five . C: Uh forty th four . C: Point point four million ? B: Four point four million . C: Point four million . B: That's a lot of fruit . A: Yeah . C: In the market . D: What about a I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? A: So . A: Well . A: No . A: Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . B: Okay . A: So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . B: Okay . A: The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? B: Okay . A: So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . A: You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . C: Mm-hmm . A: Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . A: Okay ? A: It's too difficult . D: It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . A: It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it . B: Uh . D: Okay . C: For the future prototypes . A: Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . B: That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . A: Yeah yeah , honour the fruit . D: Plus plus , okay . D: Maybe objective banana ? A: Okay . A: Thanks very much . A: We'll see n next meeting . A: Bye . C: So meeting's over ? B: Okay . B: Yep . C: Okay . B: We have to go design the prototype . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Thank you . A: Thank you . D: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next, the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. They agree on having base station with the remote. They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. After that the project manager has them discuss\/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on\/off button for the TV. Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look\/feel design. The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation. Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out. The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on\/off button for the TV. The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped. There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off their third meeting focusing on conceptual design, the team delved into various aspects of a new remote control project. They discussed the rejection of speech recognition due to cost concerns and debated the inclusion of an LCD screen. Marketing presented findings on user preferences, emphasizing a desire for a sleek design over complex functionality. The team explored the idea of a banana-shaped remote, considering materials like wood and plastic, with a preference for a stylized, ergonomic design. They decided on a banana-shaped remote with scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a basis station for recharging and locating the remote. The financial target was set at \u20ac50 million profit, aiming to sell 4.4 million units at \u20ac12.50 each. Action items included designing the look and feel, user interface, and modeling the first prototype for the next meeting, with a playful suggestion for an orange version in the future. The meeting concluded with plans to move forward with the prototype development, showcasing a blend of innovation, practicality, and market appeal.","relevance":0.4748431444,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the reasons for not going for speech recognition technologies?","answer":"The team decided not to go for speech recognition technologies due to cost concerns."},{"question":"What did the Marketing Expert emphasize about user preferences for the remote control design?","answer":"The Marketing Expert emphasized that users prioritize a sleek design over complex functionality."},{"question":"What materials were considered for the remote control design?","answer":"The team considered materials like wood and plastic, with a preference for a stylized, ergonomic design."},{"question":"What action items were decided upon for the next meeting?","answer":"Action items included designing the look and feel, user interface, and modeling the first prototype for the next meeting."}]}
{"meeting_id":"IS1004d","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Good afternoon again . A: So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . A: Um So here is the agenda for today . A: Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . A: And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . A: Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . A: Okay . A: So let's go . A: Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . A: So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . A: No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . A: We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . A: And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . A: Okay . A: Um . A: Good . A: So guys let this uh wonderful thing . C: Okay so we can go to the slides . A: Oh yeah . A: Sorry . C: Yeah . A: Um . C: Number three . C: Oh number two sorry . A: Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . C: So final design . C: Final design . C: Okay so Michael you can go ahead . B: Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana remote okay so we actually have a We've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . C: You can pull it out first , maybe . A: Mm-hmm . B: We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . A: What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? B: This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Yeah . A: Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops . B: Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . B: But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . C: Uh And we we do have one more functionality . A: Uh-huh . C: If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . B: The T_V_ yeah . A: Which one ? B: The s the turbo button . C: The turbo button . B: So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . A: Okay . C: Additional button . D: What this button for ? B: This is a teletext button . D: Okay . B: So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh To navigate yeah . A: To navigate it through th through teletext . D: But if you want to go to page seven hundred ? C: That's right , that's right . B: Yeah . A: with the wheel it's easy . D: How man I don't understand it . B: Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f Mm uh And this is the uh the infrared uh port . D: Can you repeat it ? D: Yeah . C: So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . C: And you can tele yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . D: Ah okay okay . D: Okay . D: Okay okay . D: Okay . D: I see . D: I see . C: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay . C: That's right . B: Also the top of the banana . C: Yeah . A: Excellent . B: So . B: And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . A: Calling . C: Yeah . A: Excellent . A: And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? B: Actually they do . B: That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object . A: Oh . C: Yeah . C: So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . C: It's like antennas . B: Yeah . B: So . B: But yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station . A: Great . B: So . B: Okay . A: So , what else ? C: And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . D: Is it really weight ? D: Is it light or Okay . C: It is very light . A: Yeah , they're light . B: It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . D: Okay . B: You know , to give you the correct look and feel . C: Yeah . D: Ok Okay . C: And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . C: Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so Yeah . D: Yeah yeah yeah , I see . D: I under I understand . B: I think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should consider that . B: maybe health and safety aspects . A: Ah yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Oh we didn't think of that yet . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: So for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . C: Oh yeah that's right . A: Uh you mean okay . A: So Yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ? B: I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . C: It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there . B: If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . A: You have enough surface ? A: You Okay . C: Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is . B: Mm . A: What will be the autonomy ? A: Roughly ? B: The what sorry ? A: The autonomy . A: Autonomy . B: What do you mean ? A: Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? D: How long the how long the bit the batteries long . B: Ah . B: Ah . B: A long time . A: Yeah . C: Eight to ten eight to ten hours . A: A long Yeah , so it's It's used only when you Yeah . B: No no no , it can it should be weeks . C: N most no most of the time it's not being used . B: Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so Ah , okay . C: So when when you are making it on Mm . C: Mm-hmm . C: No eight or eight or ten hours of working . C: If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . B: Okay . A: F weeks . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: That's right . A: Right . A: Next slide ? C: Yeah . C: And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . C: Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . C: And uh that's it . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Those really sounds very good . C: That's right . A: Nothing else to add ? B: It seems to be falling over . D: I l yeah . A: Yeah . D: I like I like it . D: Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . D: Looks a bit Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that . C: You want to have more functional buttons ? D: You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits ? C: You are not convinced . C: Not not many , we we want to keep it simple . C: So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . C: It's up to you , means . C: Now that Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . A: Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . B: Or can move between positions in the in the number . C: That's right . A: Yeah . D: Butto real buttons ? A: Wow . C: Yeah . C: So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . C: So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . D: Okay . C: And anyway Evalua yeah . D: Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? B: It's all automatic . D: It's all automatic . B: Yep . D: Okay . D: Okay yeah it's fine . A: Very good uh yeah you th yeah . D: W we are living in a wonderful world . B: Uh . A: Bananas everywhere . A: Okay , so So we have to go through now evaluations . D: Automatically configure . D: Yeah . A: So your slides are ready ? D: S Yeah . A: Uh you're four I think . A: So this is one , which one is this one ? D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . D: And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . C: Why this strange factor of seven ? D: Because i I'm sorry . D: Sorry . C: Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten . D: Ah yeah . D: It's from sorry , it's from one to seven . D: It's from from one to seven sorry . D: Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , and five is too short and nine is too long . C: Okay . A: Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . C: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Okay fine , got the idea . D: I'm a I I'm Sorry ? D: Yeah yeah . C: Okay . D: The variance is mi it's is minimal . A: Okay . C: Okay , okay , great . D: I'm um answering your question . C: Okay . D: Okay . C: Yeah yeah . C: Go ahead . D: And that's the criteria I I found more useful . D: I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? C: Mm-hmm . C: Sure . D: And we all four could range could evaluate the Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Seven but I would say seven . C: Okay . C: Yeah yeah . C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: So you can say fancy , handy . C: Handy . C: Yeah , it's fancy , according to me . A: Yeah , six . C: Seven . A: S seven . C: Seven by me . A: Six . C: Okay . D: It's quite fancy . C: So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus Five . A: No , wait . B: Yeah uh five . A: What do you say seven ? A: Five ? B: Five , maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's yeah . A: Okay , six point five . A: Handy ? C: Again I'll give seven . A: Seven . B: I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote . D: Six . C: Yep . A: So seven , seven , six , six point five . C: Seven for me . B: Yeah . D: Six . A: Functional . C: I'll give five . A: Four . D: I would say Everything ar Mm everything It's compared to the all remote controls . B: Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? B: You know . A: Uh for a remote control , does he have all the you could expect . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: That's right . C: That's right . B: That's before Yeah . C: The standards . C: What is available in the market off the shelf . B: I have to say four . D: Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ? B: Well it's not a universal remote . B: Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s . C: We Five . A: Yeah . B: Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess . A: So it's universal but for T_V_s . D: Yeah . A: So s uh four ? A: Five ? B: Four . A: Four . D: Four . D: Four . C: So four point two ? B: Just four . A: Four . C: four . D: So four ? B: Obviously there are some outliers so Which I'll say five . A: Okay cool ? A: Cool device . C: There I'll give it seven . D: It means cool features , like new features actually . C: That's right . C: For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . C: And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . C: We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . A: Yeah . A: Seven . D: I would say five . C: Mm-hmm . A: Six . C: Seven . A: Plus six , I say I said seven . B: Yeah . A: So it's six . B: S yeah . D: You said seven ? A: Yeah . B: Cause it's five five seven seven so Uh , okay , definitely easy to use . C: Okay . C: Definitely seven . B: Seven . A: Seven . A: Seven . A: And you ? D: Five . A: Outl you are not lik outlier . A: Seven Okay okay okay okay . D: Sorry , I have them Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . C: Okay . B: Alright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question , well , twenty five twenty five Euro question . A: Of course I'll buy the banana . B: What do you what do you guys reckon ? C: I'll say five . A: Well Twenty five Euros . C: I'll say five . B: Hmm . D: I find it quite cheap actually . D: I dunno . D: If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in I don't know . A: Cheap . A: Yeah , so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? A: It's more targeting U_K_ or So this is selling costs , not production costs . D: Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or Yeah this is the the initial specifications . B: Uh Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah yeah sure . A: Um Five . D: I would say six . D: It's quite cheap actually . B: I'd say two . C: Why ? B: I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . A: Aw , should be nice in your It's kitsch . C: No but it's really handy actually if you see . B: It is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . C: It's it's so handy . C: And then Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , but it's not a positive thing . C: It's a very positive thing if you see like that . B: Well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana . A: Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah , youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young . C: Youngsters . D: Actually maybe Yeah I change the question . B: Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so . A: Not telling that you are young . A: Li li like a teenager for instance . B: No , it's I . A: Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . B: I would buy S s Still I I'd say two . C: You want to flaunt . A: Yeah . C: You with your girlfriend or something . A: Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . C: Or might be it does some other kind of thing but Uh yeah , crazy . B: I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really . A: Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know . B: I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno . A: So you say two . B: Yeah . C: I say five . A: F I d I say five . A: You say ? A: So what's the new question ? C: And you have saved it ? D: So yeah upload the Yeah it's two different situations . C: You'll have to reload . A: Uh yeah , I think so . B: Okay , so , it depends if uh If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . D: If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . A: Yeah that's two different question . B: Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana . C: They're not going to be as And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah . A: Ugly . B: And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use . C: Yeah . D: So ? D: What now ? C: S I go slightly up . A: I stick to five . D: What range ? B: Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno . C: Six . D: Six . B: Um . A: W we have six , five Three So we are six , five , four Yeah . B: I'd give it I'd give it a I give it a four now . D: Six ? D: Six ? C: Six , five , four . D: Six , so it's uh five point five , or less . A: So So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . C: Okay . A: Um , zero . A: No uh we can't . A: So one . D: Actually yeah , I we Five ? A: Well if . A: No uh let's say I'll put two . B: Yeah . B: I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . B: If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three . A: It's for the T_V_ . C: I'll still give it five . C: Yeah . A: Two three five two three fi and two . D: You are romantic , really . D: I would say two . C: So it's somewhere three point five I think . A: So it's r Yeah , three point five . D: Who is the outlier ? D: Wh wh you said five ? C: No I said five . A: No no you say five , he is the outlier . A: Okay just just do a sum . D: I don't know if it's a No because there are more yeah , we shouldn't sum like that . B: It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . A: Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah . D: Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . C: Mm-hmm . D: Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . B: Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ? D: Uh no I didn't anything . B: Well just leave it at that then . C: Oops . D: Yeah , the uh Yeah . A: So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . A: We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . D: Do you want me to sum o I think it's not S Actually what's the differen Too expensive . A: Problem with connectors ? B: No . B: I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so . C: Yeah it's it's funny . A: Okay . A: So let's move uh let's move on . C: Yeah , sure . A: Okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay . A: So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . A: Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . A: We should we should be below twelve point five . A: So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . A: We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . A: So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . A: Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . C: Mm-hmm . B: Well we decided against the solar cells so You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . A: Oh yeah finally we say no . C: Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that . A: Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . A: So hand dynamo . A: This something we didn't thought about . A: But Yeah . C: I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: To bring the cost Yeah . A: Okay so we we stick to battery , one . A: No kinetic also . A: I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . B: Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually Yeah . A: Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . C: Yeah . A: Crazy . A: Okay . A: So those banana is falling . A: Let's go ahead . A: So we we st only have one for battery . C: Okay . A: Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the . C: So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: And that's it . A: Okay . A: No so we hin Yeah so one . C: And we have sample speaker . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: the cost of that is very high . A: Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . B: Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep simple beep , that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . A: So we are The beep . C: Uh-huh . A: That's what Okay so I'll remove it . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . B: So Yeah . B: I say that Yeah . A: S So don't we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . C: And we have sev Yeah . A: So Yeah maybe . C: So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . A: We'll see later . B: Mm . A: Okay so in for the case um I put single curved . C: Okay . C: To reduce the cost , it's okay . B: Well , wait a second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh Well d yeah it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides . A: Because we have two things . C: Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry . A: No . C: It's got a direction . A: Well . A: What a what i if I put one here . B: This is actually I mean this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you Yeah . A: Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . C: Yeah . C: That's right . B: Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it ? A: No , it's too no . A: It's too expensive . B: Well when okay . A: We're already at eleven . B: Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . A: Okay so I put rubber one . A: Okay so special colour , yellow . B: Yeah . A: Uh for the interface we have We have three . C: We don't have any push buttons . B: No , we have two push buttons . C: No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . B: Huh . A: No no . A: We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . C: Ah okay , okay . B: Uh . C: Okay , okay . D: Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . B: Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . A: And No it's no chip . A: This is just radio frequency . C: Yeah . A: Th This is no chip . D: Yeah but you need Fo i it does nothing actually ? C: No . C: There's no chip there . C: It just emits the signal . A: It's just Yeah . C: And the receiver accepts it and that's it . A: No . C: Just se sends the signal , that's it . A: Just only . B: It's a recharger thing and uh Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . A: Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons . A: Yeah , so Yeah . B: You know . B: So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . A: Okay . A: So no L_C_D_ , so for we have no button supplements , right ? C: Yep . C: No . A: Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . B: Yeah . B: No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons . A: So Okay so we are over budget . C: Yeah . C: So first thing which we should take care of is , instead of rubber , let it be plastic . B: Make it plastic instead of rubber . A: Yeah . B: And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . C: And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing . B: Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic . C: Yeah . C: That's right . C: So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go That's right . A: Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff . B: Does that include charging circuitry and everything ? A: Yeah maybe . A: Okay good . C: Yeah . A: Wha Excellent . B: So what do we do with the extra profits ? A: Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ . B: Okay . B: The next fruit . A: Yeah . A: So well we're under the the the cost . A: So we can go to through to project evaluation . D: Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . D: Would yeah , would buy . A: Sorry ? B: No we have a product which none of us would buy . D: Yeah because th th the evaluation project Ah would buy , yeah . A: Which is different . A: Which is different . A: None of us will buy it . B: No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it . D: Massively , yeah . B: We're n yeah . B: We're not in Milan or Paris . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so . B: Actually there were a lot of That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan . A: This is a battery . D: And you said the lowest . A: This is what we which you can mm It did yeah . C: S Detachable battery . D: Yeah , for the batteries Mm-hmm . A: Extra battery , yeah . A: Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here . B: Okay so um project process . A: If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . A: So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example . A: Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact . B: Yeah . A: Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . B: I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity . A: Oh yeah it's really creative . B: And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . B: We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it . A: Yeah . C: They like that . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . B: Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless . C: Biased . A: So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . B: Yeah . B: Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well . B: Might have to draw a face on it . A: Mm-hmm . B: So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . A: Yep . A: Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? A: Dunno , oranges ? C: Yeah . C: The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . C: Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . B: Yeah . B: I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , I'm not sure really how complicated our um our needs are . C: Interface . C: Mm-hmm . B: I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that . A: Hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . D: So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ . C: That's right . D: The complexity shouldn't be much higher . C: Yeah . D: For you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would Bye . B: And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . B: I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room . C: Integrate . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Very good . C: So What else ? A: So Well done . A: I think we we can go home . C: Okay . C: Home ? C: Happily satisfied . A: Yeah . A: Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yep . A: Okay so thanks very much . C: Thank you . B: Okay . A: Bye . B: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. *NA* It will be shaped like a banana, with an base station resembling a banana leaf for it to sit on. The volume scroll wheel will be on the left, channel scroll on the right. Will contain a teletext button, when pressed teletext appears and channel selector can be used to navigate through the teletext. Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station. The control will be the approx. Weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow. Will be made of plastic. Three push buttons. For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use. For pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one. For pricing reasons the remote will have a single, not double curve. For pricing reasons they eliminate the turbo button. For pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced, single curve instead of double, rechargable batteries instead of solar cells, and eliminate the turbo button.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize the detailed design of a remote control product, the team gathered for a meeting led by A, with participants B, C, and D. The agenda included reviewing previous decisions like opting for a banana look and feel, wheels and buttons, and a base station for charging and locating the remote. The team presented a prototype with unique features like a turbo button for TV activation and teletext browsing using scroll wheels. They discussed evaluation criteria, with D proposing a scale of 1 to 7 for user feedback. Financial constraints were crucial, aiming to keep costs below \u20ac12.50. The team debated components, such as batteries and plastic casing, to meet the target price. Suggestions for future iterations included simplifying the circuit board and exploring broader remote control functionalities beyond just TVs. They acknowledged the need for market research, possibly involving young trendsetters, to gauge interest in the banana-shaped remote. The meeting concluded with plans to create a real prototype for further evaluation, emphasizing the importance of user feedback and potential product enhancements.","relevance":0.6012043953,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the team's agenda for the meeting?","answer":"The agenda included reviewing previous decisions, presenting a prototype, discussing evaluation criteria, and ensuring costs stay below \u20ac12.50."},{"question":"What unique features were discussed for the remote control prototype?","answer":"Unique features included a turbo button for TV activation, teletext browsing using scroll wheels, and a base station for charging and locating the remote."},{"question":"What financial constraint did the team aim to meet?","answer":"The team aimed to keep costs below \u20ac12.50 for the remote control product."},{"question":"What suggestions were made for future iterations of the remote control product?","answer":"Suggestions included simplifying the circuit board, exploring broader functionalities beyond TVs, and conducting market research involving young trendsetters."}]}

A: Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . A: So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . A: And uh so I'm present myself . A: I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself . A: So I dunno , you can starts . B: Okay , so my name is Petre . B: You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . B: I don't care . A: Okay . D: Uh my name's Bob Mor . A: And you are ? A: In the project ? B: Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . D: Oh , sorry . D: Kay . D: So my name's Bob Morris . D: I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . B: Bob , okay . D: Bob yeah . C: My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . B: Okay . A: So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . A: We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . A: So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . A: Um . A: So what is the goal of this project ? A: Is to design a new remote control . A: So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . A: That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh uh . A: So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . A: So , um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? A: So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . A: Um . A: Yeah and everything is will be like this . A: Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . A: So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . A: So uh . B: Okay . A: For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . A: Mm . A: Uh . A: So uh So I will ask you all to do the same . B: Okay . A: Just to get used to the whiteboard . B: So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . B: Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? B: I I th I think I should . A: Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course . D: Yeah go ahead . B: Okay , so . B: Um . B: Okay , American , um . B: Um . B: I would use the bird . B: So I tried to sketch it out . B: I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . B: Can you recognise it as a bird ? B: Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay . D: Okay , okay . D: So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . A: Oh . D: That's its head . D: Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . D: Okay . C: I dunno if I should go with this . D: Thanks . C: If it is enough line . C: I'm sorry . D: Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . B: Yeah . B: I should get used to the tool , so . C: Okay . B: Oh just wait a little bit . B: C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? B: Ah probably not . C: They should be remote . B: Okay , it it works like this . D: Uh , that's better . C: Okay , thanks . D: Your lapel microphone's fallen off . B: Are you left-handed ? C: No . B: Oh , pity . C: Okay . C: Should I clean ? C: Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can . A: Never mind . C: Oh . B: Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Maybe we should just continue . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , don't worry about it . A: , no worry . D: No . C: Okay . B: You won't draw them , or ? A: You can draw it , if you want . C: I dunno if I can . B: Just try . B: I would like to see how it looks like . C: Okay . C: It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . C: I'm not good very good in drawing . C: Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . C: I dunno what is it . B: No , I think it's clear . C: Four . C: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm . C: Yeah . C: I'm shameful Yeah . D: Oh that's good , it's good . B: It's okay . B: It's in it's indeed beautiful . A: Good . D: Yeah , and strong . C: Okay . B: Okay . B: Bob . B: Have to remember it . B: Bob . A: So good um So , let's talk about money . A: Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . A: And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . A: And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . A: So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . A: Uh . A: So , um . A: The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . B: Per unit , I guess . A: Yeah , of course . B: Y oh okay . A: Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? A: So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . A: Anything . B: Okay . D: Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . D: Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . A: Mm . B: Oh . D: Um . D: So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . B: Okay , I have also some points uh . B: Maybe two points . B: Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . A: Yeah . B: And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . B: So something like this . B: And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . B: But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . A: Yeah . D: Ah , okay . D: Okay . B: You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . A: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . D: Okay , n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and you have a heart attack . B: Ah , n . B: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . B: Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . A: Okay . D: Yeah . B: Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that . A: Yeah so you can Do you have something ? C: Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . C: I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . A: Yeah , that's true . A: Yeah without obstacles and . B: Okay . A: Okay . B: Um . A: Let's continue . A: I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . D: Okay . B: Okay , just a second . A: Um . A: So we will close uh this meeting . A: So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . A: Um . A: Uh . A: The So I will ask you to do some work . A: Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about Yeah . B: Which i which is Hamed , ? C: Mm . B: Okay . D: He's the Industrial Designer ? D: No , you're the Industrial Designer . C: Yeah . B: Uh I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , uh v . A: Oh . D: Yeah , I think that's the first . A: Industry and Oh . C: Uh-huh . D: I_D_ . D: Industrial Designer . D: And the second one is the User Interface Designer . C: Mm-hmm . B: User Interf Okay . D: And then last one's marketing , which is me . A: Yeah . B: Okay , so I'm the first one . A: So , um For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um , uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . C: Mm-hmm . B: I see . C: Okay . A: And for the Marketing uh Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . A: Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . B: Sign . A: Yep finished . A: So I see you in thirty minutes . D: Great , okay . B: Okay . C: Okay , thanks . D: Thanks guys . D: Bye . C: Bye . A: Thank you .

{"meeting_id":"IS1005b","dialogue":"A: So um nice to see you again . A: Uh . A: So , uh . A: Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . A: Uh so we will see our three presentations . A: Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . D: Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? A: Yep . A: Oh , I don't think so . A: I think you have to come here . D: Okay . D: Have to get up . A: I dunno . A: I think it should stay . D: Excuse me . B: Yeah , that's it . D: Okay . A: Should stay in the square here . D: Okay . A: Oh , maybe . D: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . A: Oh , you can put it here . A: Oh that's okay , it's jus Hmm . D: Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . D: Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . D: So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . D: Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . D: Completely ugly . D: Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . D: Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . D: Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . D: Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . D: And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . D: Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . D: Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . D: Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . D: And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . D: Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . D: So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . D: And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . D: Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . D: Um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . D: We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . D: In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . D: Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . D: They want these features , they want these high technology features . D: Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . D: Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . D: So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . D: Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . D: That's my dic that's my presentation . D: Thank you . A: Thank you . C: Okay . A: So , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . A: So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? B: Well , okay , yeah . B: Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . A: No . C: B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . A: Ah . B: Okay , so . A: Sorry , I'm Sorry . C: Okay . A: Sorry . C: Okay . C: If I could go there with this cable . B: You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . B: And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . D: Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . C: Sh okay . D: It is true . C: Where's delete button ? C: Okay . C: Oh I'm sorry . C: Okay . D: That's the wrong one , I think . A: Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . C: Oh . C: Presentation three ? B: Because you cancelled it . A: Yeah you should have put yes . B: Yeah . C: Oh . A: Click on yes . A: yeah . B: Yep . C: Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . C: I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . C: Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? C: Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . C: And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . C: Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . C: Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . C: And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . C: And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . C: Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . C: They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . B: You still want me the presentation . C: There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . C: This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . C: And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . C: So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . C: And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . C: And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . C: Okay . C: That was my presentation . D: Okay . D: I have a question . C: Uh-huh . D: Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? C: Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . C: So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . D: Okay . A: So can we use any any frequency ? B: Yeah , it should be okay . A: We have the right to use any frequency ? C: Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . C: We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . A: Okay . A: And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? A: And so do they have the same frequency , or ? C: Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah , identification code inside the The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A: Okay . A: A kind of identification , okay . B: Yeah f uh I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . A: So Yeah . B: It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . A: So Okay . B: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . B: Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . C: A specific uh remote control has a specific f Mm . B: Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . B: It's worth to buy . A: Hmm . B: And they have these problems solved so . D: Okay . B: So we don't have to think about these . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . D: Okay . A: So , maybe you can talk about the function , and Open . B: Yes . B: I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . B: I was used to use Linux before , so . B: But I tried to tried to break through this too , I guess . B: Mm . B: Ah . B: Okay . B: How to make it big ? A: Slide show . C: Five . B: Slide show . B: Okay , thanks . A: It should work , so you can . B: Okay . B: Oh so I will speak about working design . B: That's the first slide . B: Uh what uh I have to do ? B: A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . B: And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . A: Mm . A: Yeah . B: So , you know . B: Uh , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . D: Mm-hmm . B: So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . C: Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . B: Uh . B: Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . B: It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec Yeah ? D: Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? B: No no no no no . B: This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . D: Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and Okay . B: Exactly . B: But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . B: This I prefer that we should make ourselves . D: Okay . B: But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . B: Same thing . B: It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . B: So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . A: Yeah . B: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . C: Mm . A: Yeah . A: So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? B: Yeah , I'm Oh . A: Or it would be maybe feasible ? B: I was not thinking too much about the price . B: But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . B: If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . A: Okay . B: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . A: Mm . D: Okay . B: We will discuss it afterwards . B: Oh , this is nothing . B: This is just my notes on what to use . B: And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . B: That's my opinion . B: Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . A: Why ? A: Because it's simpler ? B: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . A: Yeah . A: Mm . B: It's okay I think . B: And the price is fairly cheap for this . A: Okay . A: It's a a price matter . B: Well , depends . A: Yeah . B: Jus just the price . A: Mm . B: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . A: Okay . B: So I I I think it's o y o . D: What how much more expensive ? D: Are we talking three times more expensive ? D: Or ten times more expensive ? B: Well , three to three to five . D: Or Okay . B: N not ten times , but it depends what what we Yeah . D: Yeah yeah . D: That's still a lot . D: I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . A: Hmm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: So it's not worth spending the extra money . A: Well I , oh On the other side , we want to have something new . B: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . D: Yeah . A: You know , where we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . D: Yeah . A: But maybe . D: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . A: Okay . D: So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase . B: You the user interface , and management man , uh Uh okay , that's it for me . A: Okay . C: Mm . A: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Okay , thank you Peter . B: Kay . A: So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . D: Mm . A: Um first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . A: Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . A: Out-dated . A: And uh Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . A: Um . A: So I think we can avoid the teletext . A: Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control . B: I agree . A: The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . A: So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable . A: Uh , uh It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics . A: So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . A: So , um So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . A: So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? A: Uh . D: Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . D: And then we can move on to the more advanced features . A: Yeah . C: Mm . C: Yes . A: Maybe , maybe . B: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . B: Uh radio frequency depends . B: And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . A: Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? B: You should probably speak . A: I mean what do Yeah . B: Okay . D: Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . D: Yeah . A: So , yeah . D: Yeah , okay . A: So , turning channel , of course . A: Volume setting . B: Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . B: Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? B: I mean those nine plus one or two ? A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: I think it would be a b Yeah . B: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . C: Mm . D: Yeah , I Ah yeah . A: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like uh Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . C: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . B: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . A: Maybe something like that . B: Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno . A: Uh . C: Or Or something . A: Maybe Oh I don't know . A: Oh . A: Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . B: You mean like hierarchical structure . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Like categorising channels . A: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . C: Mm-hmm . B: Okay , so s Oh sorry . C: Okay . A: I It just an idea . A: I don't know what you think about that but . B: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you Okay , so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . D: To have some feedback . A: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . C: Okay . A: Okay . D: So we c you could quickly just through many channels . B: Yeah . B: Like roller for the Yeah . D: For the channels , perhaps . B: Okay . A: Anything else ? D: So we've got channel and volume . D: Um . A: Yeah . B: So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ? D: I think so . D: I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . A: Yeah . A: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? A: Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . C: So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . A: So Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . C: Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah . B: On the screen , you mean ? C: Yeah b Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . B: Not on the control , but on the screen . B: Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . D: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . C: And then Mm-hmm . D: I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . A: I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ Yeah . B: Oh . B: W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . C: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: So , what are we doing with the settings ? A: Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . A: Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but Mm . C: Yeah . D: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . D: I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some Yeah . B: Two T_V_s . A: Yeah . A: Oh yeah . B: Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . A: Oh , the . B: Or I dunno . B: Or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , well the the user not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode . D: Yeah . C: Mm . D: Okay . B: Ah , I dunno . C: Mm-hmm . D: So we have five minutes left . A: Yeah . D: Um . B: Uh . D: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: It's just how to a Yeah . B: Yeah . A: We should hide them somewhere . B: Hide them , okay . A: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . D: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Uh , okay , what else ? B: Um . D: I mean a power button's obviously uh required . B: Yes . B: This I was thinking . B: Do we need a power button at all ? B: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? B: Because generally Yes . A: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . A: It should fit in those settings functions . C: Mm . C: Settings . A: Because it's not a very current useful function . D: Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . A: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think , no ? B: Well I I uh You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . D: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute I mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . B: Uh probably . B: Okay , so we should keep this button . C: Yeah . A: Oh okay , yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: Um , you know , it was nine out of ten re relevance . B: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will turn off the T_V_ . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: If if you like this , Because , well it's maybe question for you t Yeah . D: Okay . D: B Okay . D: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Um and all the other f functionality is not used very often . A: So s yeah . C: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Like covering cu . A: On the back , or For what ? B: I mean like the Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . C: Yeah , like mobile phone covering . B: Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . B: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be Uh power button . D: I think a button . C: A button is better . D: I think it should be a bu Its own button on the front . A: Ah oh yeah , yeah . B: If it if it's a button or Okay . C: Yeah . A: Yeah a button , yeah I guess so . C: Mm . B: Okay , one nice big button . B: Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . B: Hmm . D: Okay . A: So , any other suggestions or functions ? B: Mm . D: S What about things like the clock and um timers ? B: Do we still have the time ? B: I I just wonder . A: Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah . B: Okay . B: Oh . B: Well what w what was the question ? C: Clock or Yes . D: Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display Probably not . A: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . B: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ? A: Yeah . B: Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . C: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? A: I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? C: Mm . A: This is the question . A: Is it useful ? C: Yes . D: It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . A: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . D: Kay . B: Ah , yeah . D: Okay simple . B: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . D: Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . D: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but Yeah . C: Mm . D: Yeah that's okay , that's true . D: Okay , so no time button . A: No time on . C: And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? D: Okay . B: Yes yes . A: I think Yeah . C: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . C: It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much . B: Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . B: If we use the speech recognition . A: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . A: Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . A: Uh . A: So , um . A: So now we are going for for a small lunch . A: It's uh funded by the company . A: And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . A: And uh I will do the minutes . A: And uh you are going to work on your individual works . A: And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . D: Okay , cool . A: Thank you everybody . D: Okay Thank you .

They agreed on a simple design with essential functions like channel changing and volume control, considering a hierarchical structure for channel navigation. The meeting concluded with plans for further individual work, funded lunch break, and A taking minutes. The team left with action items to explore incorporating speech recognition while balancing cost and usability, with a focus on a user-friendly and recognizable design, all within the constraints of a \u20ac12.50 per unit production cost."},{"question":"Who were the participants and what were their roles?","answer":"Check the summary."},{"question":"What key decisions were made?","answer":"Check the summary."},{"question":"What action\u2011items were assigned?","answer":"Check the summary."}]}
{"meeting_id":"IS1005c","dialogue":"A: Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . D: Hello . B: Mm-hmm . C: Hello . A: Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . A: So , uh we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . A: So , who wants to start ? C: I s No , no , you you can start . A: Okay . D: Okay . D: Okay , I'll start . A: So start , uh Uh . D: Can you open my presentation , please . D: I'm number four . D: Trend . A: This one ? D: Yep . D: Can you pass the mouse , please . D: Oh okay , that's fine . A: Turn . D: Okay . D: Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . D: Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . D: Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . D: Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . A: Hmm . B: Hmm . D: Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . D: Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . D: Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . D: From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . D: So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . D: And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . A: Okay . D: Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . B: What does it mean , spongy ? D: Uh sort of um squishy . D: Um . B: Like soft , or something ? D: Yeah soft , like a uh like a sponge . A: Like a sponge . D: I don't know . A: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Yeah . B: I will see . D: Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . D: Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . B: Okay . D: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . D: Um . A: Yeah , uh yeah . D: That's it . A: Easy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . A: It's less important , right ? D: Less important . D: So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use . A: Yeah yeah . A: Okay . D: So . A: So , Hamed , can you . C: Yeah . C: The second one . C: Could you please show the presentation number three . A: Mm-hmm . B: I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . B: We'll see . C: Yeah . A: Um . A: Number ? C: Three . A: Three . A: This one ? C: Yes . C: Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . C: Uh , n n no , it's the first one . C: The second one . A: So it's not this one . C: Uh yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . C: I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . C: Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . C: So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . C: And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . C: It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . C: Okay . C: So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . C: Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . C: It should not be completely like uh a cube . C: It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . B: Exactly . C: And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . C: And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . C: Okay . C: And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . C: Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . C: And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . C: Uh . C: And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . C: Not on remote control . C: I dunno if I can explain well . C: But uh just inside . C: For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . C: So it can be another uh preference . C: And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . C: I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . C: And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . C: So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . C: Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . C: Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . C: Okay . C: That's mine . A: Okay . B: Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . A: Yeah . B: I'm person two . B: And which one , uh probably the first one . B: I'm not sure but check the first one . B: I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but Yeah , that's it . A: This one , yeah . B: Just It's only this slide ? B: Yeah . B: This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . D: Inch . B: Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . A: Oh , . B: This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . A: Oops . B: Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . B: So there will be some circuit uh for the power . B: So , say power circuit here . B: Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . B: I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . B: So no problem . B: There can be also solar cell . B: Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . B: So at least seven to seven . C: Mm-hmm . B: It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . B: It doesn't matter . B: Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . B: So this will be T_F_T_ . B: And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . B: Interface to the microphone . B: Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . B: The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . B: So infra-red here . B: So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . B: Um I have to check what I wanted to Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . A: Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? A: For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . B: A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . B: But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . A: Yep . B: Well , sponginess . B: Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , I dunno . A: Okay . A: So Okay . C: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . D: So So Ca Can I ask a question . A: Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . B: Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . A: maybe after . A: Yeah . B: A Yeah , that's all from me . D: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , how big is it in reality ? B: Yeah ? B: Well , seven to seven inches . D: So like that . B: Yes . D: That's quite big . D: Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? B: Yeah but To be honest , I was Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . A: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . A: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . D: But I mean even even that is like this big . C: Yeah yes . A: Yeah . A: I dunno I dun I dun One each . A: But , yeah , . D: Yeah . B: But I I think we can we can cut it . D: You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . B: Yeah , no no problem , because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . A: Let's go . B: So Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . A: So let's cut the T_F_T_ . C: Mm . D: Okay , so Okay . B: So so for the same price we have four screens now . A: Mm . A: These technical engineers , huh . D: So , what's the size of the device ? B: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . B: Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . D: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Is it Can you hold that , or ? B: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . B: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . A: What user wants . A: He wants a small remote control , or ? C: Uh . D: Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand . A: Uh uh with big buttons . B: I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . C: Yes . A: It's difficult . A: A sm So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this . D: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? B: W I I think so . B: I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , but Oh , okay . C: Maybe this . D: Okay . B: Okay thanks . A: That's it . A: Okay . A: So . A: No . A: Uh , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . A: Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . A: Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? B: Not J uh just a point to the energy th things . B: If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think . A: Okay . A: So Okay . B: But we have to use the solar cell . C: So but Mm-hmm . B: Otherwise not . A: Uh like but using how many batteries , for example ? A: Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery Okay . B: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . A: Uh one two Okay . B: So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but . D: So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? B: S Uh d doesn't need to be sun . B: It it's just the daylight , you know . A: The television lights . D: Okay . B: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . A: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . B: Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough , uh . C: Yeah . A: I dunno . D: Okay . A: Okay . A: Mm . B: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? A: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . B: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . D: It's it's quite innovative , yes . A: Yeah . C: Hmm . A: Um . D: And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful . A: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . A: Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . A: For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . B: Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . B: Well what what would you guess as a shape ? B: Or what what would be the shape ? C: Mm . C: I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . C: The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . C: So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . B: Mm . C: And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . C: So we c it's like like some joysticks . C: You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . C: So the general shape should be like this . C: I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . C: So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . B: Okay . D: Which is the same area . C: It's easier . C: Yeah . D: Could you re could you redesign your board ? B: Okay . B: Five to ten . D: Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . B: Well that Yeah , right . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it ? B: We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . C: Mm-hmm . B: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . B: Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . A: Oh . A: I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . B: Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . C: Mm . B: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . A: Okay . A: So we are agree with a small L_C_D_ . B: I'll make it . C: Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . B: Fo Five by ten . C: So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . A: Yeah . C: Touching the screen . C: Something like Mm like tactile . A: Tactile or something , yeah . D: Mm , touch screen . A: Touch screen , yeah . C: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , because A smaller s Okay . A: Yeah . A: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . B: Mm-hmm . A: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . D: So Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . B: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out . A: Yeah okay . A: So , five by s ten . B: Hmm . A: Um so what about , so the case we talked about . A: Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? A: My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and A big banana . B: Seven to ten banana . B: Okay . B: Rather mango or something or . A: Um . A: Yeah . D: I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? A: Yeah . A: But it's just an idea . A: I dunno what you think about , but Yeah . A: I dunno if it can fit with the technology . A: You are the specialists of that . B: You mean banana . B: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . B: Then , yes . A: So Yeah , and The screen has to be square ? B: But if you want to look at the screen , no . B: Well Well , it can be whatever you want . C: I think this is not good . A: Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . B: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . A: It could . B: But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . A: Yeah . C: Mm . B: It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . B: But I don't care . B: You know , if we fit this requirement . D: Well I'd like a shaped screen . D: I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . B: Okay Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . A: Okay okay . C: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . B: But Like modified banana , okay . B: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? A: So we are agree with the banana thing ? C: Okay . D: Yeah , banana's good . A: Okay . B: Okay . D: Okay . B: Mm-mm . A: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . C: Yeah , I think infra-red . B: Yeah , yeah . A: Everybody's agreed . B: Sure . A: Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . A: You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? A: So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . A: In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . A: I don't know what we are going to do with that . A: You talked about the buttons on the side Mm what ? B: Like like peeling of the banana you s It would be cool , yeah . C: Yeah , peeling of the banana . B: Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . C: Yeah . C: Mm . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: And you mean the first layer would be spongy . C: Yeah . B: First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . A: So Is it is it possible to do that ? A: It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? C: Uh Mm-hmm . A: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . D: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and I think for sure . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . A: Yeah . C: If you see it's like peeling . C: You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . C: So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . C: So , something like this . A: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . B: Well is it possible to make it soft ? C: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . A: Yeah . B: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? A: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . D: Definitely . D: The softer the better . A: Yeah . B: Cool . D: Yeah . B: Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible . A: Yeah . A: Um . B: Mm . A: And setting buttons hidden in . A: Mm , other remarks , or something , or . A: Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . A: I think we are almost there . A: Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . C: Mm-hmm . A: And how Yeah , maybe . B: Pof . D: We could use Velcro . D: Or uh ma maybe a magnetic thing . C: Yes , yeah it's a good idea . C: Magnetic . A: Ma magnetic oh . C: Mm . C: Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . A: Okay . C: And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . C: So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . A: Okay . A: And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? A: Mm . A: Likes . A: Soft plastic , or Yeah , yeah , yeah . D: Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . D: In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . D: Maybe . B: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . B: So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . B: So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . D: Mm . C: Mm . D: So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana . B: It is possible , but , well if it I dunno . C: Mm . B: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . A: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: But then it must be some window there , you know . D: Okay . C: Mm . A: And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? C: Yes , I think . D: I think it's important . C: I think so . A: It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . D: I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . C: Mm . D: And Mm-hmm . A: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be . C: Mm-hmm . A: And even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect . C: Mm . C: Mm . A: So we add also the speech recognition device . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: I agree . A: So , that great . A: We have decided everything . A: And think we are on a good way . A: So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . A: Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . A: The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . A: And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . D: Okay . A: So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . A: And uh , yeah , I uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . A: And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . A: So thank you all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes . B: Okay . D: Okay . D: Thank you . B: Okay . C: Thank you .","summary":"The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating.

{"meeting_id":"IS1006a","dialogue":"B: Oops . A: So , hello everyone . A: We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . A: I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin . A: So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . A: So um we want to to do a new remote control . A: It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . A: Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . A: and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . A: Um , so let's try the whiteboard . D: Wow . A: Um so any of you who want to go . B: Yeah , for favourite animals . B: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . B: And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . D: Wow . A: Wow . D: Complex . D: Huh ? D: A cat . C: No . B: No . D: No . D: Darn . D: Uh . A: A rabbit . B: Yes , that's a rabbit . D: A what ? B: That's my favourite one . A: A rabbit . D: A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? C: Rabbit . D: Okay mm-hmm . B: That's it . A: You want to go ? D: I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . B: Hmm . D: My favourite animal is Guess . B: Wow . C: You wa Is the white okay . A: A human ah . D: A human , yay . D: It's a very complex animal and um yeah . B: No . D: Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous . A: Mm I think you're supposed to , yeah . A: Hmm . C: I guess you can . B: Wow . B: That's cobra . D: Ah , a kind of uh snake ? D: Cobra ? D: Exactly . C: Yeah uh not really . C: Small cobra . B: No , it just small cobra , yeah . D: Uh-huh . A: Is that a worm ? B: It's co c quite recognisable . A: Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm . D: What about you uh Christa ? C: Chris . B: Christa Christa . D: A fish . C: Mm . B: Hmm . A: Smiling fish . C: Smile fish . D: A smiling fish . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . D: So , w whiteboard is working ? C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Good . D: Next . A: Next . A: Let's talk about money . B: Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . D: Yeah , well . B: According to the drawings . D: Not me . C: Yeah , you're Hmm . B: Okay . D: So . A: So . D: Twenty five Euro for a remote control . A: Yeah , mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . D: Okay . A: We aim to do this profit . D: tis big number . B: On the international market . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah , we're to sell two million then . B: Wow . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . A: Kay . A: So any of you have experience in remote controls ? D: Uh yes , we have plenty at home . C: Mm yeah . D: In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . A: That So that could be a great um application . B: Mm . B: To eat ? D: To eat ? D: Yeah , mainly , and to break . A: Remote controls children proof . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Ye ye yeah . B: Children proof . B: Hmm . D: So she likes uh buttons which make click , so it has to click . C: Yeah , pret Yeah . A: Okay . A: So they have to be waterproof maybe ? D: It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh So it has to be very robust . A: Cause they eat she ate it . A: Mm-hmm . C: Ah . B: Okay , unbreakable . D: Unbreakable , yeah . B: Uh-huh . C: Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: And uh it has to be nice looking , colourful , maybe colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . A: Colourful , yeah mm . B: Colourful ? B: That's not practical . C: Yeah . A: No , that's a good idea . C: Yeah , it's always black or yeah . A: Mm mm-mm . B: No . B: But how gonna okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like Otherwise you will never find it . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: No , because you think , why not . C: Yeah . D: One colour . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? C: Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah . D: Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah . B: Cool . A: Mm-hmm . C: At least for children like one colour and . B: Ch Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . D: Yeah . D: Good . A: Good idea . C: And it should be really small and . A: Small also ? A: Don't you think No uh , not too much buttons or mm . C: Huh not so big like yeah . C: Yeah , not too much buttons and Uh . D: Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Yeah , that's Okay . A: So , I think there's So you you think it's better if small than bigger . D: So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah . C: Yeah . C: Colour , size , sh Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . D: Mm . A: No , not too small , yeah . C: Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . B: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Hmm . B: Yeah , like a palm sized . C: Yeah . D: Mm . B: Just to hold it . A: Okay . D: But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? D: I dunno if Yeah , at least the colour would be different . C: Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . C: Mm . C: S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame . A: Mm . D: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Mm . A: So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no . B: No , no screens , it's too complex . A: Okay . C: Mm . D: Too expensive for twelve Euro ? C: Too expensive , yeah . B: And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . A: And too expensive . D: Ah . B: But no screens on remote controls . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . D: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . B: Mm-hmm . C: Ye yeah . C: Hmm . C: I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? D: I don't know if it makes sense , but Yeah , for instance , mm . A: Mm-mm . C: people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah . B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . A: Mm mm mm . A: So adaptable yeah something yeah . B: Adaptable . D: Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . B: Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? C: Mm huh . C: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . B: On off ? D: Yeah . C: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . B: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh controlled by a brain , huh ? C: Two . D: Three buttons you mean ? A: Three option . D: Ah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Um . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . A: Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . B: Sh sure , sure . D: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . C: Mm yeah . C: Yeah . B: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . D: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . C: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Mm . D: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . B: Mm-hmm . B: You do this ? C: Yeah . D: Uh no . B: I usually just change channels . D: Because I'm only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was . C: Yeah . C: But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . A: Yeah . A: I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . C: Dash . A: Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool . B: Uh-huh . C: Yeah you can yeah . B: Go back button is good . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Uh uh we had that in in other countries . B: I once had it . C: Yeah yeah , the previous button is . A: Mm yeah . D: Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . B: Mm-hmm . C: Uh , okay . B: History . C: Oh uh . D: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . C: Uh . C: Yeah . C: Yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah . A: Mm-mm . D: Yeah maybe it's a Okay . A: Okay . A: So I think we have full of idea . A: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . A: And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . A: Um . A: So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . D: So what does M_E_ means ? D: M_E_ the user requirements ? D: Or that's uh that's for us ? B: Market Expert . A: Mm . D: Uh that's me . D: Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: Mm okay . D: I'll think of that . A: So . D: So ? A: I think that's all . D: Meeting's over ? D: Great . A: Yeah . B: Okay . C: Thank you . D: Thank you . B: Thank you everybody . A: See you in thirty minutes .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a \"go back\" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team. The team members will work on the ideas which arose during the meeting and decide which ones are useful and which ones should be discarded. The team members will work on the technical aspects of the remote The remote will be sold for 25 Euro. The production costs for the remote will be 12.50 Euro maximum. The remote will be child proof. The remote will be colorful and will have different colored changeable face plates. The remote will be adaptable so that it can be used by right-handed and left-handed people. The remote will feature a button which allows the user to return to the previous channel he was viewing. Size of remote. Whether to include a screen similar to one found on a cell phone on the remote. How many buttons and actions to include on the remote.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the design of a new remote control project, Project Manager Christa Pavlov gathered the team, including B, D, and C, to brainstorm ideas. They discussed the need for an original, trendy, and user-friendly design, focusing on functional, conceptual, and detailed aspects. Demonstrating their creativity, they engaged in a fun whiteboard guessing game to break the ice. Financially, aiming for a price of \u20ac25 per unit with a target revenue of \u20ac50 million, they emphasized the importance of keeping production costs below \u20ac12.50. The team delved into the practicalities of the remote control, considering factors like robustness, child-proof features, and a colorful design. They debated the layout of buttons, adaptability for left and right-handed users, and the possibility of customizable screens. Decisions were made to limit the number of actions to three main functions, with a potential history feature for user convenience. Action items included refining ideas, prioritizing important features, and focusing on technical specifications, with Market Expert D tasked with defining user requirements. The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene in thirty minutes, with each member assigned tasks to further develop the innovative remote control concept.","relevance":0.6024749875,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the important points discussed for the design of the new remote control?","answer":"The important points discussed for the design of the new remote control were functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design."},{"question":"What was the target price set for the remote control?","answer":"The target price set for the remote control was \u20ac25 per unit."},{"question":"What were some considerations for the practical design of the remote control?","answer":"Considerations for the practical design of the remote control included robustness, child-proof features, and a colorful design."},{"question":"What action items were assigned at the end of the meeting?","answer":"Action items assigned at the end of the meeting included refining ideas, prioritizing important features, and focusing on technical specifications."}]}
{"meeting_id":"IS1006b","dialogue":"A: So I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . D: So Of course . A: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . A: Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I don't remember which is not very good . A: Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah . D: Nice stuff Who starts ? A: So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert . D: Oh . D: Ha . D: okay . A: So wait a minute . D: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? A: Mm . D: Yeah ? D: So it's being modified . D: Do you want yeah , open . D: Read only . D: I hope I saved it . D: So , um yeah , this is my name . B: Sammy Benjo . B: I know this name uh . A: Sounds uh Mm uh . B: We met before . D: So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . D: I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . D: So next please . D: Uh-oh . C: Yeah , it is put F_ five . A: Hmm . D: Hmm . C: The full page presentation , yep . D: Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . B: F_ F_ five . A: Okay . C: Yeah . C: Yep . A: F_ five . C: Yeah . D: Uh-huh hmm okay . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . D: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . D: Don't forget about that . D: So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . D: And next please . D: Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . D: First of all , they find it very ugly . D: Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . D: Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um . D: And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . D: For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . D: And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . D: Um next please . D: Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is . C: Yeah . D: Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? B: Agree . C: Yeah . D: Like uh something to to like t I think phones . C: Yeah . D: Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . D: Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control . C: You can you are . A: Why not ? D: But why not ? D: Yeah . D: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . C: Hmm . D: And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . D: So I think they are bad . A: Okay uh tha that's look great . B: R_S_I_ mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Mm nobody has any idea about that ? D: Well I'll check uh with my Oh , okay , I think it's a technical thing which our Okay . C: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . B: No , I don't think so . C: Yeah , because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high Uh . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Okay . D: So , it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account . B: But twenty six percent , do you know Twenty five . A: Or something we don't know . C: Uh . B: Every fourth , you know . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah it's People really Yeah . B: Every four some of us knows . A: Okay . D: So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um what else do I have ? B: One of us Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Next slide ? D: Ah yeah . D: So we've listed a couple of uh s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . B: Functions . D: People want to have a power button . D: Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant . D: Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury . D: We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah , channel selection is um very important , very often used . C: Uh . D: Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . D: And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . D: Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . D: All of them . D: they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . D: It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . A: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . D: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think . A: Mm-hmm . D: But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . D: Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . C: Hmm . A: Mm-hmm Mm-mm . B: Mm-hmm . D: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . D: For instance I think net next slide . D: One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . D: So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . D: Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . D: And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . C: Yeah . D: So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? D: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . C: Cause Thank you . D: If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course , depends on that . A: Okay . D: And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . D: And uh , if you have any question ? A: Mm I think it's good , okay . A: You done a good review . B: I got one question , uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not ? D: I can go back . D: Yeah one question , yeah ? D: I am . D: I think we should aim at the young people . D: But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . C: Mm . D: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than Then teletext is useless for them I think , yeah . B: Okay , then teletext is used less . C: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . D: Because they they have other means of finding their information . B: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm mm mm . B: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: Okay . D: But yeah . A: That's good point . C: Mm , yep . B: Mm . B: Okay . D: Nope . D: Kay ? A: Okay . C: Thank you . A: So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um Of the technical function , so uh what effect Okay . D: So I think it's you , huh ? C: Uh it's techni function of Yeah . D: No ? B: That's me . D: No , user requiremen Makes sense . A: Wait a second . C: I have to do working design so uh . A: Argh . A: So you're Okay . B: That's but this but number three , yes . B: Mm-hmm . B: So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . B: However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . B: Uh , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . B: So next slide please . A: Let's go . B: And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor . C: Mm . B: We should never complicate things too much . B: We should only make a remote control , nothing more . B: Nothing more than this , just a remote control . B: Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . B: So , make a click , please . B: So here is this remote control . B: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . B: But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . B: Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one which one would you prefer ? C: It's Yeah , yeah . B: I guess this . D: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . B: Sure , sure . C: Yeah . C: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two li S you should yeah . B: Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple simple desires into simple actions . A: Oh sorry . D: Nice . D: Nice sentence . B: Findings . A: Okay . A: Oh sorry . B: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . B: Concept . B: Be simple . B: Be simple and you'll lean on this market . B: Market is a of remote controls you know it better , it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? D: Mm . B: So be simple . B: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . B: It's a really good style , it going to be look like like this . B: It is unbreakable and it is very universal . B: W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen . D: Mm-hmm . B: We'll need only few buttons . B: All the other things can be controlled through the screen . B: And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . B: So Press I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium I think , and uh what else ? C: Mm . B: I got just very few and good ideas . B: We need power and volume . B: And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . B: When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , the T_V_ turns on . A: It's off . D: Hmm . A: It's on . D: And when does it turn off ? B: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time like uh you It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . D: Oh so you have a sensing sensor machine that uh knows Tech Mm-hmm . B: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . B: Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . B: Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . A: Or you want to go to the kitchen . B: It's easy to do , you just control the According to the distance . D: According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . C: Distance . B: Yeah yeah yeah . D: Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? B: So I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . D: Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? D: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . C: Yeah . B: So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? C: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . D: Okay . A: Mm . B: So basically that's it . A: Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . B: Can be easily done , 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . A: Yeah . A: Hmm . B: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . B: You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . A: Mm-hmm . B: Just few actions , a few actions for everything . C: Mm . A: Hmm . A: S Mm . B: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . A: Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . C: Mm . B: Okay , okay . C: Yeah and it mm . B: Okay , but it's quite universal you know . C: Mm . B: We can just extend it to any device . C: Mm . D: So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ? B: Uh twenty five . D: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . D: You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . B: Mm-hmm . B: In fact I would propose another solution . D: Or is it ? B: Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? D: Most people yeah . B: Yeah . B: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . D: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . A: Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . D: I uh B yeah . C: Yeah . A: Hmm . C: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because Yeah . D: Go to channel twenty five . D: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . D: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . B: Mm-hmm . C: But still Yeah . A: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah . C: Yeah . D: And it's only next . C: Yeah . D: Yeah so but you have to Okay . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: We got these buttons here . B: Next next . C: Yeah. . B: Or say this can be back . C: Yeah . C: But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then Yeah . D: So it would be Okay . A: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . D: Mm-hmm . D: Alright . C: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . D: Listening more . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . B: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? D: Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Okay . D: I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . B: Okay . D: Although I don't know . A: Okay . B: Alright ? B: Thanks for your attention . A: Uh you're finish ? A: Okay . A: So now the technical aspects of this new device . A: Mm . C: Two . C: Yeah , if Sorry . A: You prefer it . C: Yeah . C: Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . C: I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . C: So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . C: Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . C: So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . C: So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . C: And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . C: And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . C: It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . C: Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . C: So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . C: And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . C: Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . C: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . A: Mm . A: Okay . C: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . C: So we need to have particular encryption codes . A: Okay . C: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . C: Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . C: And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but Yeah . A: On Uh train it , okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Too complex . D: But uh very very good to sell . C: No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . D: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . B: Okay . B: Okay . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah . D: Whatever . A: And what about the price of this component ? C: So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . A: It mm okay . D: Hmm . D: Cheap . D: Millions . A: Mm . A: Okay . D: Cheap . A: Mm-hmm . D: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down . A: Mm-hmm . C: Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah . D: Okay . A: With a keywords and yeah . D: Okay . D: Couple of words . A: Mm-hmm mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: Okay . B: Um . C: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it it will be take care of our main mm . D: Of course uh it has to be Okay . A: Okay . B: Okay . B: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . D: But then I think you you First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . A: No , in no not only speech , yeah . D: It's on top of using the button . B: Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros . A: I it's an option . D: Well , I dunno . C: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . B: Mm-hmm . C: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . C: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here Yeah . B: Okay. . D: T_V_ . A: Okay . B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . A: Sho to to train , okay . B: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? B: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down . C: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and Yeah , even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and Yay yeah . A: Mm . D: Very expensive , no ? A: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . B: Mm why ? B: That's just We got a really good Market Expert . D: And volume control . D: So but uh Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? D: So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . D: We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . C: Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I They can make Yeah we can have Yeah . D: Hmm . A: Wouldn't that make uh arguments ? D: Yeah , of course . A: I want uh And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with Mm-hmm . D: That's no problem , we will sell more . D: Yeah exactly . B: Let's send more , let's sell more . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: You have mm something else to say ? C: Uh , not very much , like yeah . A: Uh . A: No . D: Okay . D: Thanks . A: Okay , thanks . C: Thank you . C: Yep . C: Thank you . A: So mm mm I think , okay , we're just on time . C: Can you just yeah . A: Um mm mm . A: So , we're now going to l have the lunch break . D: Mm great . A: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . C: Yeah yeah . C: Mark will Uh it's in current price , yeah . A: So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . A: Well I think that's all . A: And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? A: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . D: Difficult . A: Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . C: Yeah . C: But speech recogniser can be possible . A: Yeah , implemented . A: O okay , we can think about that . D: Mm-hmm . A: And um do you see something else ? D: No . B: Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? D: Speakers in the remote cont Oh yeah . B: Like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is I'm here ? A: Uh yeah that's Or maybe you want to phone him . B: Or Just beeps ? D: It just beeps . D: That would be enough . D: Something very cheap . D: But that's ex that's expensive . C: Yeah yeah yeah . A: Since now all yeah ? D: Uh . C: Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and Yeah . A: Think Uh-huh . D: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . A: And uh And it's answered . C: Yeah . B: I can't whistle . B: No , no , I can't . D: You can't whistle . D: Uh-huh . D: Or a clap . B: Mm . A: Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal . D: You can clap . D: Can you ? C: Yeah . D: Clap is good . C: Yeah . D: Tak Just a suggestion . A: What about people without hand ? B: Okay . A: Yeah . D: With only one hand ? C: Yeah I think it's good . D: These are not our target people . A: Mm uh okay . C: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . D: Mm-hmm . D: Oh that's e that already exists okay okay . C: Oh . B: Yeah , I got it at my home , like . A: Mm-hmm . D: Oh yeah , you do have . B: Oops . D: Wow . C: Ah it's Yeah . D: You're trendy . A: Mm-hmm , so let's to think s so that yeah . D: Think about it . D: Yeah , okay . A: I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . A: It yes . D: Okay . A: Okay . D: Good we're done ? A: So , yeah , let's go to lunch . C: Yeah . D: Right , thanks . C: Thank you , thank you very much .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly, difficult to use, have a number of unused buttons, frustrate users when misplaced, and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power, channel selection, volume control, and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs, discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen, and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing, the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced. The industrial designer will focus on the components concept. The user interface designer will focus on the user interface concept. The marketing expert will work on trend watching The team will not work with teletext. The team will concentrate on making a remote only for televisions and then make their product more generalized later. An automatic on\/off feature will not be used. Making the remote universal. Users habits in jumping from channel to channel. How speech recognition commands work. Allowing users in the same household to have their own remotes with personal settings. How to locate a remote when misplaced.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, the team delved into the new project's requirements, focusing on user needs, technical functionality, and design aspects.

{"meeting_id":"IS1006c","dialogue":"A: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . D: Mm-hmm . A: Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . B: How was lunch ? A: Mm great . D: Thanks Don't be sarcastic . D: Mark . A: So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . D: Uh Rama . C: Ramaro . A: Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . B: Mm . A: So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . A: And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . A: And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . A: It's So , let's go . A: First with Rama . A: Participant two . C: Yeah , participant two . C: Component . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yep . C: So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . C: For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . C: First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . D: Ah . C: And we can use some , moving kind of thing . C: So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . C: So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . C: And we also want to look at our remote control , so . C: Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . C: So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . A: Mm-hmm , okay . C: So uh we discussed an Excuse me . C: So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . D: Mm-hmm . C: And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . D: What is a double-curved shape ? C: Like you can have two curves . D: Uh-huh . B: Why ? C: Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . C: So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost . B: Mm-hmm . D: The cost . A: Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . C: Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and Yeah . A: Okay . A: You m titanium it's more uh Yes so mm Uh-huh . B: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know Yeah . D: Mm like this ? C: Yeah . C: Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Okay . C: But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay . C: And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for S S Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so Uh l So uh it's like a Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money I guess , because Okay , yep . A: Uh yeah so Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . D: Speech L_C_D_ . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Okay , and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? B: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . D: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . B: No , it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . D: Ah . B: Okay , so let's try it , let's t Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . D: The L_C_D_ would The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . D: Just uh for output , yeah . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Mm . C: You have any further questions or ? D: I guess no um . D: So the batteries uh are going to be very light . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price . D: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . D: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . C: Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . D: Mm-hmm . C: If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . A: Okay , for the location . A: Hmm . D: Okay . A: Okay . A: So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? D: No , it's okay . B: No more questions . A: Um mm thank you mm . C: Yep . C: Thank you . D: Puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that . B: Mm yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible . A: Yeah , but mm . C: Oh . D: Anyway . C: We have uh some limitations . D: Yeah . B: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , L_C_ I'm an artist , sorry . D: L_C_D_ . D: L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . A: Okay . D: So , go on uh artist . B: So uh , that's not I hope that's not too much . A: Um yeah . A: Now let's talk about uh interface . B: Okay . B: Uh participant number three . A: Three . C: Three . B: Uh mm mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah . A: Which one ? D: Hmm . A: Okay . B: Uh so the concept of the interface . B: Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . B: So let's start with this . B: We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? A: Mm . B: Or no ? B: I can see nothing . B: So that's our concept . B: It's called the millennium remote control . D: Let's change millenniums . B: Yeah . C: So maybe you can use in the end and Uh Mm . D: doesn't make sense . D: This is very ugly . B: Really ? B: I thought you like it . D: Oh no , too much concept . B: Ah okay just press the button , please uh . D: Ah . A: No . B: Yeah , we will not use this . B: We will not use this . B: But instead of this I will devise That's our concept . D: Ah , back today . B: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . A: Mm-hmm . A: Kay . B: And uh what will people say ? B: They'll say it's perfect . B: Or what will say ? B: Uh they will say it's splendid . B: And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . A: Mm-hmm . B: And everyone's gonna be satisfied . D: Do you think it can come in several colours ? D: Or did the Um but not the case . B: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . B: Not the case . D: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . B: Yeah . A: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? C: Yeah . B: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . B: Do you like it ? D: I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , but I don't use that but again , uh I might Yeah , bu but Mm-hmm . C: But it's uh But it would be expensive , no ? B: That's why you don't have it . B: That's why , 'cause it's nasty . C: If you use colour L_C_D_ . B: No . C: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . C: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . B: Um , I am here . C: So users have different I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro . A: Okay . A: So ? B: Mm-hmm . A: Uh-huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , yeah . B: Kay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah yeah yes . C: If they want like uh so that we can yeah . D: Kind of upgradable uh remote control . C: Yeah . D: Wow , wow . A: Okay . C: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours . B: Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah . C: Lights , yeah . D: Mm . A: And thermodynamic also . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Like a chameleon . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah yeah . B: We can make it in fact . A: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . C: Mm . B: If if if the okay . D: Mm-hmm . A: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , but Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , so Uh-huh . C: Yeah . D: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . D: Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . D: My remote control is pink . D: Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . D: And that makes me special . A: Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is Okay , so so i it's not uh a s base service it's a Mm . D: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . D: Those who wanted to have it pink . C: Uh Mm . D: No mm no . B: So , be an option , yeah . D: It might be optional , yeah . A: Okay . C: But those people will be really few , no ? C: So like we can those Ah . D: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . D: Although similar but have something just slightly better . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Pink Mm . A: So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . C: Mm . B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . B: And it makes you different , you know ? D: Yeah , yeah . A: And you'll be different . D: You always have your remote . A: Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . D: Oh , you don't ? B: Anyone has their remote controls here ? D: Yeah . D: You don't have your remo Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . B: No ? A: Want to change my neighbour . D: It's a kind of remote control . D: Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . B: Mm-hmm . D: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . A: Mm . B: Okay . D: White . B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . A: Mm-hmm . B: Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? D: Seems important . C: Hmm . B: That they can use it in darkness , like . D: Mm glow in the dark , so Okay . B: Hand light , yeah . C: Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: Iradium ? B: Okay . C: Yeah , that Oh . A: Ah sorry . B: Okay . A: Mm . A: Okay . B: Okay . B: S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation . A: So mm Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: Uh-huh , yeah sure . B: And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? B: And uh I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to Mm-hmm . D: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . D: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . B: Okay , okay . D: I dunno . A: Mm , that's a nice world . B: So just just just just think about it um . D: Don't touch the remote . B: Thank you . A: Okay . D: But yeah . D: Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? D: So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . B: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart . D: Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or Mm . B: Voice recognition is quite tough . B: I say don't use it , and the control just looks . C: Yeah . B: Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . D: Um Mm . C: Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess , like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah . D: Okay . D: So it could be smart in that way . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Mm . A: Okay . D: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . D: S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , sure . A: Mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Uh it's Hmm . D: The remote that knows you . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Okay , thanks . A: So it's yeah , Marketing Expert . D: My turn ? D: Okay , it's alright . A: Participant two ? C: Four . A: Four , sorry . D: Four , I think . D: Trend , yeah . D: No uh yes . D: Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . D: So , next slide please . D: So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . D: Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . D: We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . D: Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . D: I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . D: This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . D: So anyway uh next slide please . D: Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . D: The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . D: And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . D: It has to be fancy . D: Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . D: So as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . D: And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . D: Next slide please . A: Mm . D: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . D: If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . D: And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . D: That's the thing with trends . D: It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . D: Fruit and vegetable . D: Think fruit and vegetable . D: And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . C: Mm . B: What is spongy ? D: Well this so so I think uh uh i When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . C: Yeah kind of um maybe Yeah it Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . C: Yeah . D: Seems not , seems not . C: We need to think about mm mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . D: So Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . A: Um sorry Mark . A: It seems to be Mm-mm . C: Fruit . C: Even shape ? C: More yeah . C: Yeah . D: I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm . D: So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and Okay that's all I have to say . A: Hmm . A: You're old-fashioned . A: Sorry . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: Mm you have questions ? C: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? C: Or it's This you you so did you Where ? D: These I'm sorry . D: Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well . C: Oh . C: Oh , okay , mm-hmm . C: It's not from mm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control . D: No , it's not it's not this this is very general , yeah . D: But it seems that trends travel across things . C: Mm . C: Yeah . D: The what we Sure . C: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah . D: Yeah . D: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . C: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's Yeah yeah that yeah yeah . D: This is your problem . D: This is not mine . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , looking yeah fruit . C: These things can be easily incorporated . C: We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah . D: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . D: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Okay ? C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: No more question ? A: Okay . D: Yep . D: Thanks . A: So Mm-hmm . A: Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . A: Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . C: Look and feel de Hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . C: Hmm . C: Mm sounds interesting . A: Mm-hmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . D: Okay . B: Okay . D: Thanks . C: So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . A: Yeah you're right , you have to So you say s S do we agree on that ? D: Spongy . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: We have to . C: So , do you think Hmm . B: So we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? D: No , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . A: No . D: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . C: Yeah . D: So there's no Well , that's you t can try to convince us . C: Yeah . B: Well , we can make it smell like fruit . D: Okay . A: Okay , that's a good idea . C: That's So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? D: that's a good idea , I Uh I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't . A: So titanium smell like fruit . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Or they really like They more want these fancy features like Feature Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Okay . D: It's fancy . D: Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . C: Yeah . A: I I agree with uh this uh Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . C: Yeah . A: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Mm . C: Yeah . C: Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah . D: Maybe you could explore the two option . A: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . B: Could we make a titanium shape ? C: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d Hmm . B: I mean fruit-shaped . A: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah . B: But Doub double-curved . D: Mm . D: Seems to be . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . B: Okay , okay . B: In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . B: Well , okay w we'll see . A: Mm-mm . A: Okay , so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . B: Yeah We'll see . C: Mm . A: Or or spongy an yeah . C: Yeah . C: Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . A: Mm . C: we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or Uh . D: If you have time . B: We'll see . A: Mm . A: Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . A: If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both . B: We'll see . B: I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look . C: Yeah . D: For creation . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . C: Even design . D: You can paint it afterward . B: Okay , okay . D: No problem . D: We have a very large department of paint . A: Yeah , do don't worry , you you you speak with mm mm . D: You will do it . B: Alright , alright . A: Okay . A: So explore a shape . C: So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? C: Or Okay . A: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . D: Yeah . A: Not uh Mm-hmm . D: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . C: Yeah , then we can yeah , yeah , that user friendly or Mm . D: Yeah . A: Mm . D: That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing . C: Yeah . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Okay . C: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah , because Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . A: Yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Mm . D: Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . D: So . A: Yeah . D: Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So it's very Okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: So are we mm . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: We're done . C: Yeah , we're done . A: Okay . A: So see you in thirty minutes . C: Yep .","summary":"The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting.

A: So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . A: Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . A: Then , w we And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . D: Yes . B: Yes . B: And chocolate ? A: And that's all . D: Mm . A: Okay . A: So first , let's uh see the prototype . C: Yeah . C: Uh , here we have our prototype model . A: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . A: And you have some slides then ? C: Yeah . C: Yeah , we have also some slides . B: Yes , and place some slides . A: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Okay . A: Uh so in which uh Mm okay . C: In Yeah . B: Uh , participant three . B: Prototype . A: Mm . C: Five . B: Uh , so this is our remote control . C: Him . B: It's a r working prototype . B: You can use it now by switching all these buttons . B: So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: That's well , so that's that . B: Please , next slide . B: We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . A: MASA ? B: If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . B: And um , s society will accept that . D: Mm-hmm . B: For sure . B: And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . B: S please , next slide . B: But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select . B: And it's practical . B: And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . B: And as I said , it's perfect . A: Okay . B: Please press it . C: Experience . C: Explanat See this . B: Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device . D: Such a nice thing . B: So you can touch it with your hands . D: Can I ? D: Ho-ho . B: Sure . C: You can Spongy . B: Yes . A: What do you say ? B: N You must say it . D: It says I will uh I'll buy it . B: Yeah . A: One day . D: If I if I need so . A: He Hmm . D: Hopefully my daughter will like it . B: Okay . B: Y and we got the answer . B: Uh , it is , yes , of course . D: Yes , of course . D: Of c course . B: , please next slide . B: Um , this is a prototype . B: You can have a look at it , and That's all I wanted to say . D: Ah . B: Now it's technical specification by our colleague . C: Hmm . C: So Yeah . D: Oh , there is a button missing . D: Okay . C: This this is really flexible . C: You can add your buttons . D: It's in option . C: Yeah . C: So function , mm So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . A: Mm-hmm . C: And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . C: Then you ha you'll have volume control . C: So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . C: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . C: Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . A: Mm-hmm . C: And we have speech recognition . C: Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . D: Hmm . C: And it can also do the action . C: And location finder . C: And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . D: Mm-hmm . C: You can just say , where is my remote control . C: Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . D: Hey , babe . A: Bobby . C: And then , it will say hi . D: Bob . D: Hey Bob . C: Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . D: Okay , that's good . A: Mm-hmm . A: Hmm . A: Kay . C: So , um our team is now fruits . C: Mainly strawberry . C: So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . D: Oh , these are strawberries . A: Are colourful . A: Yeah . C: Material , we want to stick to titanium . C: We will send , we want to Yeah , or s So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . D: Fruit smelling spongy titanium . D: I didn't know it exist , but that's great . C: You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . C: And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . D: Ha . A: Ho-ho . D: You mean we can change the colour uh of th Yeah . A: That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? C: For the L_C_D_ . D: Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . C: With titanium it's it is silver . D: Tit titanium is Uh , okay . B: We are still working on titanium . A: Mm-mm . C: Yeah . B: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . C: Mm , yeah . B: You can ask Bob . B: It's Tuesday . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , Bob , please . A: Hey , you know you're theme today . D: Tuesday colour . C: Yeah . C: Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s And you can have many colours on weekends . D: Okay . A: Hmm . D: Mm-hmm . D: Black for Sunday . C: Or Huh ? A: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? D: On the L_C_D_ ? A: Wh wh Mm-hmm . D: Oh . C: Ah , these are like sensors . D: Of course . D: What do you think ? B: That's location sensors . D: Strawberry sensors . D: Very useful . A: Okay . A: Strawberries . C: So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . A: Ah . D: Lounge meeting . B: Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . C: Yeah . B: Um Oops . D: Alright . D: Good . A: Okay . C: S So , any specific questions for Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: So , huh . D: Interesting . D: In interesting . D: Mm mm . A: Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into W Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ? D: It makes sense . B: Let's make a party first maybe . C: Yeah . C: Then we can discuss We can Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . D: So uh , this is What a design . A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Uh , so Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . D: It's my turn . D: Mm-hmm . D: Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet the evaluation criterion . C: Yeah . A: Oops . C: Fudge . D: Yeah . D: So , evaluation please . D: So . D: You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . D: So mm Uh , next slide , please . D: As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . C: Yeah . D: Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . D: To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . D: One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . D: And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . D: And we're all l going to list all the criterion . D: I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . A: Okay . D: And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . D: So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? C: Fancy . D: So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . D: Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . D: So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . A: Mm-hmm . D: So , what do you think , is it fancy ? C: Huh . C: Yeah , what's is really Uh , it's really Yeah . A: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . D: It is very very fancy . D: Or have you ever seen something like that ? A: Oh . A: I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . D: Yeah , of course . D: What do you think ? A: Uh what do you think ? B: Feel the weight . D: Is it The weight is later . C: Oh . B: Really . A: Uh-huh . D: Now we're We're on the fanciness now . B: Okay . D: I think it's quite fancy . C: Yeah , yeah . D: It's uh Yeah , so No it's it's one . C: We can give at least five or six , seven . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: It's in the other . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . C: Oh , Oh . C: So Oh , okay . A: Mm . C: Yeah , okay . C: Oh , okay . C: So M maybe two . D: So it's one or two . D: What do you think ? A: Two . A: Let's say two , yeah . D: Two ? D: Okay . B: Two . B: Two . D: So here , two . D: Up . D: Then we have uh technology . C: Technology . C: Yeah . C: Um And we have L_C_D_ . D: So , what about technology ? D: We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ . C: So you change colours . A: Change colour of t Yeah , I think it's a Yeah . D: Change colour , I mean that's very Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . C: Useful . B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Uh No . C: It's silly . D: At least a one , yeah . A: Mm-mm . D: Robustness , uh-huh . C: Uh , still we need to cha Yeah , it Maybe strawberry . D: So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . A: Um The strawberries Oh . D: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? D: Uh , maybe not the prototype . D: Let's try . D: Oh my god . D: Okay , we just lost one strawberry . D: So Not at all ? C: Oh . B: No . B: How can I say this . C: Yeah , we can easily plug it . B: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . D: It is Yeah . B: A strawberry . D: Yeah . D: So it's not so bad . A: Mm-mm . D: I um uh I would say three . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . A: But it's too . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? A: It's um robust , yeah . C: Useful ? D: Useful . D: Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? C: Yeah , Yeah . D: So I don't know . D: These buttons are uh It not clear . A: Oh , yeah , lets me try . D: But you have at least uh next produce . A: Yeah . A: What is uh next , please ? C: Yeah , channel . C: I this is volume control and channel changes . D: Uh , it depends on the Okay . C: These are the main You Yeah . A: And you can uh do di two sites ? A: Yeah . C: Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . A: Okay , also . D: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . C: So if you don't want Yeah , um yeah . A: You can , by using the You c push here the the yeah . C: Yeah . B: You can . D: Directly . B: You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . B: So that's simple . B: The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . D: Yeah . B: With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . D: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . D: Uh-huh . C: And channel . B: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . D: Okay . B: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . D: Yeah . C: You can select . B: You select twenty , you select five . D: Okay . B: That's it . C: Yeah mm . D: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? B: No . D: Don't you think so ? D: May not okay , we can go . D: That's uh You're right . C: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah . D: That's it's less uh Yeah . D: But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . D: But So what do you think for it , usefulness ? C: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah mm . C: So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . D: Seems to be useful . C: So so Yeah . A: Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . D: Both . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , two Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Up down or left right . C: Yeah . C: Up . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: And which what is that ? D: That Cool . B: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . C: This is jog wheel . A: Okay , okay . C: Yeah . A: It's a kind Oh , okay okay . B: Like , selecting the menus . C: Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . A: Oh oh okay , great . D: I would say then uh Two or three ? A: Now it's looks us useful . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Two or three ? C: Yeah . C: Two , maybe . D: Two . D: Okay , two . A: Yeah . D: So size and weight . C: Yeah , yeah . D: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? D: Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ? C: Yeah , it's size al almost Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . D: Uh , and and It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . C: We will s We use titanium . B: Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . A: Mm-mm . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Of course . C: Heavy . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . D: Not sure if uh she can use it . C: But sides uh , the sides should be okay . D: So , should be okay . C: Yeah mm . D: Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape . A: Mm-mm . B: Okay . C: Oh . B: Okay . A: Uh-oh . D: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . A: Yeah . C: The case is silver titanium , no ? D: It's a it's going to be titanium . A: Yeah , it's . C: Yeah . D: Okay , okay . D: That's nice . A: Let's imagine . D: I think it's good . D: Okay . A: And what about the strawberries on the top ? A: I'm not convince . D: Yahoo . A: But maybe I'm not trendy . A: But , uh Yeah , but uh uh they're not useful . D: Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . C: Oh . C: Yeah , yeah . D: So Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . C: Yeah . A: I I mean it that's uh Mm-hmm . C: So maybe , I think Yeah . A: Yep . C: Yeah , well Yeah . D: Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . C: Um Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . A: Hmm . D: But this If it's Uh-huh . A: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . D: So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . A: Yeah . C: Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . A: Mm-hmm . A: But the n Yeah . C: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . A: Mm . C: So it's Even These buttons But it looks really not really good . D: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh I suggested three . A: No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this I It's n no , it's not fancy any more . C: I mean , the f Yeah . C: So these are kind of rubber things . C: Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . A: Okay . B: And Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . C: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and Yeah . A: Uh-huh . A: And different routes . A: Okay , I see what Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control . B: Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . A: Also . C: But this is really fancy . A: Okay . A: Okay . D: Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite You have good arguments . B: Okay . B: Okay . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: But And uh the last one is adaptive . A: Okay . D: This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? C: Yeah . B: Sure , sure , just look at it . D: Great . B: It's full adaptable . D: Fully adaptable . A: Wow , that's a Yea Yeah , it's fudge titanium . B: Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . D: That's Yeah . D: So you can fit into your palm , okay . D: That What else can we need ? C: Yeah . C: You can Yeah . D: You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? D: It's fudge , yeah , yeah . A: You know . A: Right , yeah . B: Mm , It's two point one seven . D: Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . A: And uh Okay . D: Well , I if if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . C: Yeah . A: Let's go for one . D: Okay . C: Yeah . D: Now we have to do the average . C: Three , three , six , eight , eleven . D: Who is good in math ? D: Okay . D: Two point one seven . D: That's nice . D: Two point one seven out of seven . C: Hmm . D: I think we have a good good thing . A: Yeah . D: Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . D: So It seems to be good , yeah . A: So it's a good evaluation . A: Yeah . C: Yeah mm . A: Mm . D: We have uh Yeah . C: Yeah , two one one seven , we have . C: So Financi Energy . A: Mm-mm . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Thanks . A: Okay . A: So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ? D: Ah-ha . A: So , I have an Here . A: Um . D: So so how many batteries do we need ? C: Uh , we use bat One battery . D: One battery ? C: Yep . A: Okay , so two . D: Good . D: Why two ? C: Oh , we just need one , I guess . D: Say no . D: No , ne never install . A: Uh-huh . D: Two batteries or one ? A: Oh . C: No , number is one . C: We need only one battery . D: Only one . A: Yeah yeah , but the price is two . D: No , no . A: Oh , number . D: But no , no . B: No , uh you just Number . A: Sorry sorry sorry . C: Number , number . D: No , no way . A: I'm sorry . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: You never use uh Excel ? A: Oh . A: No , never . D: Good . B: How What what's the limit ? A: H Okay . B: Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . D: It's twelve bucks . B: Twelve bucks . D: Twelve bucks . B: Okay , now Mm-hmm . D: Twelve and a half , I think . C: So we We have sample chip . B: Check that number also . D: Okay . D: Okay , electronics . D: So It's a simple chip ? C: Uh , like simple chip , yeah . D: Simple chip , okay . C: So , yeah . D: One . C: Yeah . C: Four buttons at least . D: Okay . C: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . A: And for the One also . D: One or two ? C: Yeah , one to one . D: One ? C: Yeah , one . D: Okay . D: So the case , which one uh is it in the end ? C: Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ? D: Let's do a single curve . C: Oh , is Oh . B: It's it's flat . D: It's flat , and curved . C: Oh , okay . A: I thought you can curve somebody . B: It's flat . B: But it is flat , you Look . D: It's curvable . B: It's curvable , but it's not curved . D: Maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? A: Mm-hmm . D: It's only curve ? D: Okay , let's go . A: Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one . C: Yeah . D: This Okay , you d We tried , we tried . A: Yeah , yeah . A: Don't chip on me . C: Oh . B: Oh , okay . D: So , what is it ? C: Titanium . D: T titanium ? A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . D: Mm , that's expensive . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-mm . B: Mm . A: Yeah . A: But she wanted u the fudge titanium . D: Okay . C: Yeah , well No , only one , no ? A: I think it's five , but you don't say . D: Let's stick to s titan . D: Special colour ? D: No because uh Yeah . B: Well , n Why three ? A: Mm . B: Why three ? A: Oh , sorry . A: Again , I'm See it . C: Um Interface . A: Special colour , or it's only on the Yeah , but there is no colour here . D: Oh . C: Yes , in L_C_D_ display . C: Ok Yeah , an Yeah . A: So I put it here . C: Push-button . D: So the L_C_D_ Two . A: How many push-button ? C: Scro Uh , two . A: Three or two ? A: Is there The scroll-wheel , okay . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: It's going to be expensive . C: One scroll wheel . C: One L_C_D_ displayed . A: Okay . A: Um That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one . D: That's all ? D: No . C: Yeah . D: Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? C: Yeah , it's cheaper . A: Or only a scroll-wheel . C: Yeah . D: Or only only scroll wheel , okay . C: Only scroll wheel . C: Yeah mm . C: So It's already Ah . D: You are trying to make make up make us up . A: You try to s No , no , no . A: Because how do you do to y select ? D: No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ? C: Y ye Yeah . A: Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you Stay longer . D: That's true . D: Yeah . C: Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . D: Yeah . C: And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really Special colours , yeah . D: It should stay . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Oops . A: Okay , okay . A: Um Mm-hmm . B: For buttons . C: Okay . C: Yeah , buttons and strawberries . B: No , buttons just normal . C: Yeah . C: Special form . A: You you have all of these , no ? D: She's very hard on this . D: Special colour ? A: Mm maybe n not this one but Yeah , so Not special colours an interest in ? D: Yeah . D: No . D: Special material ? C: Uh , we have titan Yeah . B: That's for buttons . B: But buttons are standard . D: Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . D: Yeah . D: It's only buttons , these . D: Nothing special . D: Okay . D: So we are at seventeen dot eight . D: No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ . A: And buttons are not colourised ? A: They are m Boo-hoo . D: I no . C: Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . D: We can just use this red . C: Yeah , and uh Yeah . D: It's So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? A: It's already too expensive . A: Apparently . A: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Uh , until we get twelve fifty . A: Mm-hmm . A: Mm . C: Oh . A: So think of what we can cut uh here . D: Well , if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker . C: Sample speaker . C: Yeah . A: Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . B: So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy to make electricity . A: But you don't need a battery ? B: Yeah , that you don't need a battery . A: Mm . D: Mm-hmm . B: So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . B: A real high-tech version of it . D: So that would So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . A: But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ? C: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand is Yeah . B: Okay , but l Why not . D: That's already that . A: Uh it's a it's a beginning . D: Okay , let's do that . C: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Let's do that . A: So One here and here . C: Yeah , just remo S Yeah . A: Kay . B: And I propose to So uh , about chips . B: Advanced chip on print , right ? A: Mm-hmm . B: So , put minus one there , please . D: I'm not sure if this is legal . A: Mm . B: Why not ? A: That's right . C: Uh , no . B: And ? D: And ? A: M maybe minus uh three , no ? D: No . C: Yeah . D: Okay , let's see . B: So , was there result ? C: No , no . C: It's not It's not changing , no ? B: Let's have a look . A: Mm-hmm . C: It you don't So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah , if Click somewhere , you'll see features . B: Why ? A: Mm . B: Oops . D: Yes , it does . D: Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh more reasonable . A: So Oh , sorry . B: Yeah . B: Why not . D: Yeah , anyway No , minus two . B: Minus . A: Mm-hmm . D: Nobody will know . A: Mm . D: It's not recorded , is it ? B: Good . D: Okay , we're on time . D: Good . A: Okay . A: Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . C: Maybe we can use it for our party . B: And a battery and a battery , yeah . A: Oh . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Both its it's cool . D: No , now we are exp exceeding I think . B: Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two . C: Yeah , that No , but point five point three . D: It Is it ? A: Mm . A: Yeah , yeah y Yeah . D: I think we're exceeding now . D: We have to remove the Uh , it's better . C: Okay . D: I think they are counting uh We would prefer , yeah . C: Is really strict ? A: Mm . A: It's maximum and don't have to Yeah , yeah . D: Maximum is maximum . C: Oh . D: So , remove one of them . A: Uh Uh , mm-mm . C: Oh yeah . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: Okay , we're uh on target . A: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Okay . A: Mm . A: So target reached . D: I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print . C: Ho Oh . A: It's um English uh Yeah . D: Trick . D: Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins No , no , no . A: Yeah , but uh is uh English . A: So Mm . B: Well , I don't know . C: Uh And we can discuss all these things in our party . B: I don't know . B: I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know . B: Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number . A: Mm , let's try . D: Let's finish this meeting instead . A: Okay . A: I save it uh Okay , so next mm No , that's yours . D: What else ? D: No . D: This is right . A: Sorry . D: Okay , so finance , that's done . A: Kay . D: Are the cost under twelve ? C: Mm yeah , very much . D: Yes . D: Project evaluation , good . A: Okay . A: So now We have to make um Yeah . B: Next slide . D: Project process . D: Safe uh asse uh safe assessment . A: Yeah . A: Mm . A: See mm how Are we a good team ? A: Mm . D: Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . B: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . D: Everybody could say what they thought . A: Mm . D: And uh Yeah . A: Is there enough room for creativity ? B: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Mm . A: And you . B: Yeah . D: When we see the results , there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership ? C: Yeah , it's really Yeah . A: Mm . A: Oh . A: Okay . A: Well , project evaluation . B: M maybe not , huh ? D: Team-work , very strong , I would say . C: Yeah , our team-work is really strong . D: Team-work , no problem . D: Means . D: Whiteboard , digital pens . C: Oh , we still , I guess . B: What was the Oh yeah , what was good ? B: Everything . D: Yeah , I think white-board is useful . B: What was bad ? D: Digital pens , useful . C: Hmm . D: New ideas found ? A: So , you say , is there sheep ? D: Yeah . A: Luck . A: Okay . A: So luck , but good . A: Which imply good uh team performance . D: But uh Yeah , but uh then I I mus That's true . B: Yeah . B: A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and Of course . D: And there's uh one very important point . C: Don't really . D: We're on time . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Meetings finish when they have to or even before . C: And we also Mm . C: We made Mm . D: The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing . B: Uh Not to waste time , that's important . A: Okay . A: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , we have other uh remote controls to create . C: Hmm . B: We need time f New materials . A: Okay . C: Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . A: A lot of uh Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial Mm . D: Mm . C: New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design . D: Mm , yeah . D: Hey , just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh . C: And new tricks . A: Mm . A: They're working on um pink titanium . D: They are working on a Okay , good . C: Ah , very . D: I think we are great . B: Budget . D: There's no no other words for that . C: Yeah . D: We are probably the best . B: Alright . A: Mm yeah . D: Real Reaction is uh Yeah . A: Yeah , we're really nice . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Mm . A: Okay . D: Finished ? A: I think it's Yeah . D: Ah , celebration . D: Are the costs within the budget ? D: Of course they are . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Uh How Yeah . B: Okay . D: Is the project evaluated ? D: Yes , it is . C: Yeah , yeah , it's We got two Good score . B: Yeah , it is . A: Mm . B: So , we see , we can even forecast . B: they propose us like celebration , everything , we could forecast it , right ? D: To whom ? D: To the whole our company ? A: I'm the one , proposing the celebration . A: Of course , you know I'm the program manager . B: You ? B: It was you . B: Okay . C: Oh , okay . D: So , let's celebrate . D: Uh I think the meeting The meeting is over at least . A: Mm-hmm . C: So where we will go now ? A: Ah um , I think it's finish . C: Uh , ye Will go to Italian restaurant , or Ah , okay . A: Yeah . A: Mm . D: So , we have to go out . C: We can decide . A: Mm-mm . C: Yeah . B: Okay . A: And we go to the party . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: Thank you . A: thank you to you . A: Mm .","summary":"This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. *NA* After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo. When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget. The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval. Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager. The prototype was more than 40% over budget. The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the detail design meeting, Christa, Mark, Rama, Sammy, and the team gathered to evaluate a prototype remote control. Mark and Rama showcased the working prototype with technical specifications, emphasizing the use of titanium for its modernity and practicality. Sammy proposed evaluation criteria, leading to a team discussion on fanciness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, weight, color, shape, and adaptability. They decided on a hand dynamo for energy production and debated cost-cutting measures to stay within the budget of \u20ac12.50 per unit. The team's strong teamwork and efficient meeting management were highlighted, with a focus on creativity and new ideas for future projects. Celebrations were planned, with Christa suggesting an Italian restaurant for the party. The meeting concluded with a sense of accomplishment and readiness to move forward with the project, ensuring that the remote control design met all necessary criteria and financial constraints. Action items included further refining the design and planning for future projects, showcasing a collaborative and innovative team dynamic.","relevance":0.5973802805,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What material was emphasized for the prototype remote control design?","answer":"Titanium was emphasized for its modernity and practicality."},{"question":"What were some of the evaluation criteria discussed for the prototype?","answer":"The team discussed criteria such as fanciness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, weight, color, shape, and adaptability."},{"question":"How did the team plan to produce electricity for the remote control?","answer":"The team planned to use a hand dynamo to produce electricity from mechanical energy."},{"question":"What was the budget constraint per unit for the remote control design?","answer":"The budget constraint was set at \u20ac12.50 per unit, and cost-cutting measures were discussed to stay within budget."}]}

D: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , I think so . B: Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . D: Yeah I think assign your uh roles . A: S For each for each one . B: In each We already have our role . D: For each person , yeah . B: Kay , we can So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . A: So there are so we have three f yeah . A: We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . B: Okay , alright . A: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? A: Any any volunteer ? C: I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Uh No , I'm doing the interface . B: I'm doing the interface . A: You are doing th . B: Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay . C: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . C: It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright . A: Okay , I'll for industrial design . C: Yeah . A: Okay . A: And and you Norman ? B: Mm ? B: Um working on i . C: User . B: User interface . A: And And doing the marketing . D: Uh , I'm into marketing . D: yeah nothing much in the project . A: Nothing related here to the Next . D: Marketing in this design . D: A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . B: Yes . B: You see the second mail ? B: Yeah , it's inside . B: Go down . B: Appendix . D: Yeah , this is . B: See there's a role for everybody . D: Yeah , that's right , first . B: Even for the marketing . D: us user define . B: But look at your role , your marketing role . D: There's a trend watching . A: I don't know . B: Yeah , that's your role . A: I . C: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . A: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? A: Mm-hmm . C: So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work . D: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Yes . D: I mean working remotes we already have . D: This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . C: Yeah , I dunno I Yeah . A: What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . A: And of course it should not be very costly . D: Yeah , that's right . A: So About the about what ? B: Mm-hmm . C: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or Yeah . B: Need to collect information . B: Um . B: I I'm part of design , perhaps . B: Uh , what is most important in a in a remote control ? B: What is the most important function aspect ? B: Uh . A: You mean the external or Yeah of g of course . C: Well , you have to make it work . C: That's the that's the big thing . B: That's alright . B: Yeah , it should be easy to work with . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah , yeah . B: Uh . B: We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . B: You just tell the television I want which channel . B: Or or you can say for example , um I want uh to list all the programme tonight . A: You won't I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . B: Y you know , instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . B: Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . B: Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . B: And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . B: So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . B: Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . B: No , because no , it's not very a lot . A: S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . B: Th this information exists . B: For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything . B: The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . C: I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah . B: Yeah . D: I'm a okay . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . A: In the hand . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . B: Yeah . B: Yes , possible . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: But Yeah . D: And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . A: Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . D: I need not have an I mean we have some or something , different technology but Mm-hmm , yeah . A: This is it's Mm-hmm . B: Yeah , yeah . B: But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . C: On the content . C: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah . B: So it's more powerful . B: Yeah . B: No . B: No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . B: They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . B: We don't care . B: We just say that this are some content . B: We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . B: Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . B: Download it uh to the to this remote control . B: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . A: Mm . B: The most there are only seven buttons . B: So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . A: Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . C: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . A: This is good idea . B: Yeah . B: Ah , yes . B: So . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? B: Good idea . B: Okay . B: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . B: Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . B: Yeah . C: So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please , Norman , draw uh Okay . B: Alright . B: Okay . A: So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we S You it . B: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . B: Five minutes . D: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . B: Okay . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: The lighting in the room changes . B: Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . D: I mean , we have a option in the remote control . D: If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . B: Okay . B: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? A: Yeah . A: If if you you you can if you want you can use th the . B: Go on , draw something . D: Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . B: Mm . B: Where is it ? D: The lapel . A: Or before the before the the design that says . B: Ah , okay . B: Where where is it ? B: Here . D: Yeah , that one . D: Just plug it . A: Norman . D: Yeah , that's right . B: Mm . A: Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . B: Mm . B: Okay , alright . B: So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . A: Yeah . B: Right ? B: We agree on that , right ? B: Uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . A: Okay . A: Yeah . B: Uh to choose uh content s or channels . B: So we have both . B: The user can choose w which one they want , right ? C: Yeah , by content or by channel , it's a good idea . B: By content or by channel . B: Choose by contents or by channels . B: So And then what did we say just now ? B: Other than this . C: And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . A: Mm . B: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . C: Yeah . B: Challenge . C: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting . B: Okay . B: Content . B: Okay , so these we have to work it out . B: So this one of the problem . B: And uh The main thing . B: Okay . B: Alright . B: Alright , okay . B: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? B: That's the first aspect . B: Right . B: We will get information and then we'll come back in . C: Okay . C: Thank you everybody . A: Okay . B: Yeah , we'll come . A: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? A: And we'll discuss the other other aspects . B: Alright . B: Alright , okay . C: Okay . A: Okay . A: Well thank you all .","summary":"The Project Manager introduced the project to the group.

{"meeting_id":"IS1007b","dialogue":"A: So we come again for the the second meeting . B: Mm-hmm . A: Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . A: And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . B: Okay . C: Okay . A: And we have think I got a new project requirement . A: So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . A: So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . C: Okay . A: And of course we should have our image in the in the design . A: So , let's start with the the industrial designer . C: Yeah , alright . C: So uh Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here . A: Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . A: Here . D: Just go to explorer . D: Or open . A: Oh okay . D: Participant two . C: Participant two . A: This one . C: Yeah . D: Open uh . C: Uh open . A: Do you want to open Ah . B: Because it's open you mean . C: Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . B: F_ five . D: Slide show , view slide show , . C: So uh can you go one page down , please . C: So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . C: So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . C: Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . C: And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . C: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . C: Okay so can you go down uh So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . C: Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . C: And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . B: Did you draw it ? A: Wow . B: This . A: This . B: What is the other chip for ? B: The one on top . C: The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . D: One is a communication . B: For men . B: To the in Okay . C: And , that's it . C: I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t It's field programmable uh something array . B: Mm . B: What is F_P_G_A_ ? D: Gateway arrays . C: Yeah . D: It's a field programmable gateway arrays . B: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? C: Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . B: Yeah . B: Programme it . D: Yeah . B: Okay . C: And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . B: Yeah . B: Uh So this are the they have to work together ? B: Or ? B: Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay . C: No . C: Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . D: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? D: And the second one is for the software . B: Is the is the software par alri okay . D: Yeah to run th to make it run . C: Yeah . D: That's it . B: Okay , okay . B: So you can control if you want , right ? C: Yeah . D: No . C: Alright and that's it for the working design . C: So if you have any questions ? B: Mm . D: Okay , and how about the battery power ? D: Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? C: Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t . D: Into the more compact and uh okay , . C: Yeah , yeah . C: And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm . D: Okay . B: You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . C: It's a good idea . D: Yeah , that's right . B: Yeah . D: Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . B: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . D: People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . B: Yeah . B: Mm . D: We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote , we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . B: Uh mm . B: Y yeah , yeah . B: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? C: That's a good idea . A: You can i yeah . A: Ma Yeah we can change the b . C: Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . B: I dunno . A: Yeah . C: S okay , so charger for is the . A: Um . B: So is mine . A: It's mine . B: Oh . A: Participant one , no ? B: Yeah , this your Yeah . A: Mm . A: Oh we have so let's move to to user interface design . B: So you can open uh three . A: Participant During the weekend . B: Yeah . B: So So I'm working on the technical functions design . B: can you show the next slide . B: So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . B: So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah . B: I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . A: That's good . A: Mm-hmm . D: G Yeah , not the T_V_s . B: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . B: So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah , yeah , yeah . A: This are usual functionality . B: Ours is a bit uh different . B: So these are two example . B: One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . A: Tasks . B: This is the most competing prototypes I've found . B: But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah . A: And they are small . B: O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy . C: Yeah . C: Of course . A: Mm-hmm . B: So you so you move to the next the next one . B: Yeah , so I talk about the problem . B: And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . A: Yeah . B: So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . B: You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . B: From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? B: And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . A: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ than the So we should have specific T_V_ ? B: Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah . C: So we have to t We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . A: Or ? A: We can use this . A: Yeah , we don't Yeah , I think so . B: Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . A: J j just the remote control . C: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes , that's a good idea , I think . B: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's right . B: Okay . B: So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? A: Mm . A: Yeah , we . A: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Okay . A: Speech recognition . B: N yeah , that's all . B: The next one ? B: So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . A: Keep the navigation but . C: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . C: It's easy to build , it does not consume much power . D: Yeah , that's right . B: Okay , that's all . D: Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . C: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . D: Uh-huh huh huh huh . C: Maybe you . D: Mm-hmm hmm hmm . B: If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . C: but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . D: But Yeah then yeah that's right . A: So you are Mm . B: Ah . B: Ah , a big jump . B: A mouse or Yeah . D: Mm hmm hmm . D: Okay . D: Okay . B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . C: But we'll see . A: How the this remote ? B: Uh it's gonna be small . A: Yeah , of course small . B: Yeah . B: So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . D: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . D: Yeah , that's . B: I dunno how bu And responds to you , and I- mm . D: just give it a name and we call him . D: Yeah , that's right . D: Yeah , that's right . C: Okay , so uh next presentation Mm . A: Participant four . A: So Harry . D: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . D: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is . C: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah . B: But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . B: I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm . D: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . D: We just have the it's not going to take much space also . C: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons so it's a good idea . B: Yeah . D: It's going to be very slim . B: Mm . D: And next one was the size of the remote control . B: Mm . D: It has to be of course a very slim and small one . D: And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a trade-off . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: But Mm . A: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . D: The features and the cost . B: Yeah . B: I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . A: Yeah . B: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , yeah , extra features . D: Little bit more if it's with extra features . C: Yeah . A: It Yeah . C: Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well , uh Well , we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so I well it will be alright . D: Okay . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm . D: That's right . A: But is it useful or not u I don't know . B: Yeah . A: There is in the Mm . D: I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . B: Mm . D: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . B: Mm . B: Mm . D: So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . D: And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . D: Mm , I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . A: I think i If it's necessary can you can do that . B: What is the teletext ? B: Mm . A: We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem . C: Yeah . C: Okay . A: What about lighting adaptive options ? A: According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . A: Yeah . B: It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . A: Mm . B: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? B: Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? B: It's very complex . D: I mean I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . C: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light . B: Mm . D: I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . B: Yeah , then we can conclude that . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . A: So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . A: Mm-mm . A: So any things to to discuss ? A: Or any suggestions ? D: The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . A: Expensive . A: Price . B: Mm . D: And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . B: Mm . D: And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . B: Okay . D: If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . B: Yeah . B: Okay . D: And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . B: Mm . D: And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . D: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . C: Function . D: That should be a good uh point . C: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? C: I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? A: I think we we can we is the . C: Yes . C: Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . B: Mm . C: Because if Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . B: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? B: Or what ? B: I didn't quite understand Yeah , okay . A: Yeah . C: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . D: We already have some . C: So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah . A: So you have to anticipate the the future ? B: Yeah . B: The future demand , market demand . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's right . C: Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . B: The functionality in the future . A: In future . B: Alright . B: Yeah . B: Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . B: All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . B: Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . C: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah , . C: Okay . A: Okay . C: So Okay , thank you . A: So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after . D: Okay , thank you . B: Okay . B: Thank you .","summary":"The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities, and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote, and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. He suggested a simple design with few buttons, small size, and a locator function. The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages. The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television. The remote will be used with a recharging stand. The group decided not to include a lighting adaptation system. The participants disagreed on how to easily move through channels using the design of the User Interface Designer, which included very few buttons. There was no resolution on whether or not to allow users to use the remote to access the internet through their television, as opposed to including teletext capabilities.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the second meeting, the team gathered to present individual work and decide on the design and functionality of a new remote control.

{"meeting_id":"IS1007c","dialogue":"A: So we come to the third meetings . A: I have good . A: Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . A: So we will talk about some specific details . C: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh I'm participant two . C: Components design . A: This Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . C: Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . C: So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy . C: We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . C: Now Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . A: But if we use battery We will , okay . C: So uh it's a point to discuss . C: Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . C: But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view . C: Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . B: Mm . C: And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . C: So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment . B: Mm . C: So um so I think we can start with these two main things . C: For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote . C: For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper . B: Mm . C: And s so uh we can move to the next slide . B: Sorry . C: Yeah . B: What is this single curved what does it mean ? C: Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . B: So it's it's not Yo l yeah . C: You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the Yeah . B: When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . C: It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? C: Yeah the um that's the point . C: The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . B: That that's what it means by kinetic . B: Okay . B: Mm-hmm . B: Okay . C: But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . C: Yeah . C: And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . C: So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . B: Mm mm . C: So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . B: Wha Ah the department . B: Mm . C: That's it . B: Uh So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . C: Oh yeah I take care , it's all right . B: So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . C: All right . B: Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . C: Yeah . B: There's another point I want to make , is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use Yeah . B: Yeah , maybe n Yeah . A: Three . B: So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . B: So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . B: The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . A: What's the function of this button . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: So . A: I think it makes the the interface really Graphical user interface . B: Ea easy to use . B: So next one . B: function five . B: So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . A: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . B: Yeah . B: So next line . B: So the here are some examples . B: So they cluster the buttons together . B: They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . B: Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . B: Uh basically there are too many buttons . B: Right . B: Next one . C: Yeah . B: So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . C: Mm-hmm mm mm . B: So I just got an email saying that . B: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . C: Yeah fine . B: The next one . B: Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . B: Touch screen , I mean . A: Yeah . B: Next one . B: And some people propose a scroll button . B: Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . B: Like the one we have here . B: Uh , next one . B: So mm so there are a few aspects that I collected here . A: Mm-hmm . B: So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . B: And uh mm yeah yeah . B: And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . B: So But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . B: I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . B: Yeah , so that's the point . B: The next one . B: And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . B: Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . B: And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . B: So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: S a good idea . B: The next one . B: So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons . B: At I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . B: But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . C: Yeah . B: And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . B: T_V_ remote controller where are you ? B: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . B: Is it possible ? A: We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? D: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Uh ? C: Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: And uh , this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . B: So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . B: But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . A: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah yeah . B: And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . B: Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . B: And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . B: Yeah . B: So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . C: Hmm . C: Yeah . B: And basically uh Yeah . C: Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . B: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Okay . A: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . C: Yeah . C: That's a good idea . C: To have a help button . B: A help button . C: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: So you are display on the screen . C: On the T_V_ screen . A: On T_V_ T_V_ screen . B: So on the T_V_ screen . C: On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . A: So just you push the button and we will Yeah . B: Okay . B: Okay . D: Oh . B: Okay . B: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation , okay . B: So wi Yeah . D: But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . A: If the if No In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . C: Uh yeah . D: It's a psychology . C: In a marketing point of view . D: Okay . D: And let us see what the market demands . D: We could just go to my presentation . A: Yeah . C: But uh wel well I think Uh well . A: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . D: Yeah that's right . B: Mm . D: I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the Same remote with some Both yeah . A: So So it's the same Can be used by both kids and old people . B: Mm . B: Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . A: Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to Yeah . B: Small Yeah . C: So le le let's see what uh what people want . B: Let's see the market demand . D: And then we can decide what what we can yeah . B: What what market yes yes . D: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . D: And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . D: Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . D: And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . D: So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . D: And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . D: And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . D: And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . D: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Yes . D: So this were the findings which we found . D: And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . D: Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . B: Yeah . D: And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . D: So they're frustrated a lot And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . C: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Mm , the functionalities yeah . D: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . C: Yeah . D: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . D: We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . B: Oh . C: Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . B: Big screen . C: It's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really Yeah . D: Mm-hmm ? B: Yeah . D: I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . D: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . D: It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . B: Mm yeah . C: Yeah yeah . B: Mm . D: We just play around Yeah . B: The thing Yeah . C: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s Yeah . A: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , maybe even better . A: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: So Yeah . D: I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . C: Yeah . C: Yeah yeah . D: So the other one Yeah that's fine . B: Yeah . C: So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . B: Yeah . B: More on a fancy design . D: Yeah . D: I mean that's Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . A: But Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Uh yeah we have uh I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . B: So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . B: Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . C: So price of uh L_C_D_ display . B: Is i if i Yeah . D: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . C: And Yeah . B: Yeah . B: And also the cost for the speech recognition . A: Mm . B: Ask our R_ and D_ department . A: It's for it's just for small vocabulary . B: Yeah . D: Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . A: We it's not yeah . B: Yeah . B: And ho Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Yeah okay . B: And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . C: And Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . A: Yeah . D: Mm , the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . A: Push push . C: Yeah . D: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . C: Yeah I think that Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . B: Yeah . B: Don't use the buttons . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . B: Important . C: Yeah . C: But But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you Yeah . A: But they are just less used compar yeah . D: They're not used much . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Yeah , yeah . B: So so the at most more power uh . A: Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . A: So . C: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . B: Yep . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . C: You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh Yeah but Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so . B: Yeah . A: Mm . D: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . D: Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . D: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . B: Mm . D: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . B: Mm . A: It's And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . B: Mm . B: I if Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah that has to be checked out . B: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , with the help of speech recogniser you can Yeah . A: I You will listen to a peep , special peep . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Okay . D: I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition . B: Mm . C: Yeah . D: And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: A and Mm . D: And the third problem was to find the remote control . D: Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . C: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t Yeah . D: So Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . B: Where , yeah . D: Or it could be also something like this , uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . B: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Yeah . B: Put it back at the charge . C: Put Yeah . B: Yeah . D: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . B: Yeah . A: Okay . C: And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . A: Yeah . B: Mm . D: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . C: Yeah . A: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . B: Hmm . B: Mm . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . D: I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged . B: Th yeah . A: You have to keep it . C: Yeah . B: Mm yeah . C: Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: There's mm . C: Also and uh uh the remote is lost . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Yeah that's right . B: That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . C: Yeah . B: You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . D: It's an good reminder , yeah that's right . B: Yeah . B: So you will never get lost yeah . C: Okay . A: Maybe for some people lazy people . B: Yeah . B: Yeah because everything is programmed inside . A: Yeah yeah . B: So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y Mm . D: And of course the final point is a fancy look . D: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . B: Mm . C: They were ugly . C: They Well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original , so Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . A: Mm . D: I think we should have something it I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . B: With uh two two two parts controller . D: But you can have an button for child lock . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Mm . D: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even Mm uh That's right . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . C: Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: Or Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: these are probl yeah . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: So if he . D: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included . C: So for mm yeah . B: Mm . A: Yeah . C: So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . C: Yeah . B: Mm . B: I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . C: Yeah . B: If numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by by name Mm . A: Mm-hmm . C: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh That's right , yeah , yeah . D: No , we have a problem there . D: You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . A: Yeah it's yeah . D: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . B: Mm . C: Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . B: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Yeah yeah . D: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . C: Yeah but well okay . B: Mm . B: Mm . A: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . D: So it's better to have some prefix before the number . B: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . D: Yeah something , some code . B: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . C: Yeah yeah . B: So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . C: Mm mm . C: Well I Yeah . D: That will be too big . D: And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . A: Or just It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . B: Yeah . B: Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . B: Uh ? A: It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . A: Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . B: Well , it's convenient for the user . D: Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . A: Or maybe Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . D: Then Yeah , the . B: The uh uh mm . B: Mm . B: I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . B: So Mm . A: Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . B: So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . A: No . A: Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . B: Oh , okay . B: Yeah . C: Well I uh I also I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . A: By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own . D: Yeah yeah , . C: Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run , s Yeah , yeah . B: Mm . A: Or you have to s Yeah . B: Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . D: Yeah . B: Mm . D: A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . D: If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . B: Mm . D: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . A: Mm . C: Yeah . A: Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah . D: Yeah that's right that should be an option . B: Mm . C: Yeah that's well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . B: Hmm . D: I think these are the practical problems . D: So we need to take care of them in the design . A: Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . A: It's time to close this meeting . C: Okay . B: Well , you you stay a five minutes . D: Okay . D: Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Okay . C: So I see ya . A: Thanks for your collaborations . D: Okay . D: See you another thirty minutes .","summary":"The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons. The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push, scroll, or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer. The group will find out if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and the scroll button. The group will ask about the capability of the voice recognition component. The group decided not to include a help button on the device because it would make the remote seem more complicated. There was not enough information about the capabilities of the voice recognizer or the kinetic energy source. There was not enough information on the cost of several components. No decision was made about whether or not the LCD screen should be included. No decision was made about including a locator function, or what form it should take. No decision was made about making the remote programmable for children.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team delved into the conceptual design of a new remote control, with A leading the discussion alongside participants B, C, and D.

{"meeting_id":"IS1007d","dialogue":"A: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . A: So . B: Okay . A: So let's see the what did you prepare . B: Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? B: Mm the shared folder . A: Sh share folder for th your presentation ? B: Yes . B: We have a presentation . A: Because I have here Okay just one . B: Uh So I got the participant uh three . B: W uh . B: Three . B: It's the final design , yeah . B: S so so I discussed with Guillaume . C: Mm . B: Right . C: Yeah . B: And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . B: So we come up with two versions . B: One with and one without L_C_D_s . B: Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module . B: And detachable big buttons for all people um . B: So . C: S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . C: Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . C: You you can s here . C: And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . B: Mm . C: You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . B: Mm . B: Mm-hmm . C: You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . C: And here the the switch that control if you want Well I I I think uh it's the Yeah but Yeah . A: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? A: It's not a good place maybe . B: No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . B: The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . D: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? C: Well so it's a microphone array . A: Oh it's very costly , microphone array . D: Mm-hmm . C: No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . B: Yeah Mm . D: Yeah . B: Yeah yeah . D: Okay . C: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . C: And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . A: How much does it cost this one ? C: Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila . B: For the Yeah . A: Fifteen dollars ? A: Ah it's above it's above the budget . D: The cost would be le reduced . C: Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . B: Mm . B: Hmm . A: How many b battery is there ? C: How many , excuse me ? A: Battery . C: Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh Yeah . B: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . B: A_A_ rechargeable batteries . C: Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger . B: Yeah rechargeable batteries . B: We have the charger so it's no problem . C: Yeah and you just On uh yeah one battery . A: So one one battery ? D: Is that two or one ? A: It's kinetic reserve . B: Actually uh it's a flexible thing . B: You just n uh Yeah yeah . D: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? C: The excuse me ? D: Whole day's rating . D: What type of battery ? C: Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist . D: Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? C: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . C: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Then the next time you pick it , oh it works . B: At uh yeah . B: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . C: Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . B: This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . A: Mm . B: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . B: So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . B: So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . D: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? B: Yeah . C: Yep . B: This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . D: Yeah . B: Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . A: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . B: Mm . A: If you Mm-hmm . B: Uh okay this is new prototype uh . C: Yeah it's So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . C: The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . C: So basically th it's the same uh yeah . D: Uh-huh and also the switch . B: Yeah yeah . D: Okay . C: Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . C: But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . C: Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . B: Mm . C: So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . D: Mm-hmm . C: And uh it's also cheaper to produce . C: We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . A: No four dollars , it's good . D: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ? B: Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our Yeah . C: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . C: So so Norman will explain to you . B: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . D: Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . A: And we will we will serve the charger with this ? B: Yeah . D: Okay . C: Yeah yeah of course mm . B: Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . A: With the remote control . A: Okay so the price of the charger included in the Mm-hmm . B: Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . C: Thank thank you . C: And so mm-hmm . B: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . B: I think we have to investigate more on that , but Yeah . A: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . B: Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . A: Well that's so We have we have just The price of selling is twenty five Euros . D: Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . A: And the price of production That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . C: Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features . D: Or uh Something like customised . B: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . B: If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular . B: Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . A: Okay . D: Mm hmm hmm hmm . B: So It's pretty flexible in the yeah price . D: Hmm okay . C: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . A: But Mm-hmm . B: Uh yeah yeah you should present that . D: And this is other one ? B: Yeah . C: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . D: Mm hmm hmm hmm . B: Yeah Mm . C: We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . B: Hmm . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . B: Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . B: But in addition with simplicity . B: So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . B: Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . B: The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . B: And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? C: The titanium and so it's very uh Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . B: Titanium material . A: Titanium . B: Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . D: Yeah that's fine . B: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . B: So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . D: Okay . B: Yeah and um And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? D: Mm hmm hmm hmm . B: And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . B: So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . B: So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . B: Yeah . B: And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . B: And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . B: Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the Yeah . A: What what's Maybe yeah . A: What's the price to p to produce ? C: Uh it's about it The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . A: With with with the charge ? D: With the charger ? A: Okay . C: Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . C: So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . A: We don't have charger . C: It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . D: I think we can use Excel . A: We don't have all the options . B: Yeah . A: Charger we don't have charger here either . B: Yeah . A: No it's it's below the the the budget . C: But it's just if you want all functionalities . B: Yeah . C: Excuse me ? A: It's below the bu the budget . D: Yeah it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . A: We Yeah . D: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: We can wind up . D: Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . D: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . D: And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . B: Mm . D: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . D: And the third one is easy to use . C: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . B: Mm . D: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . B: Spongy spongy . B: Mm mm . D: So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . B: Mm mm . D: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . C: Okay . B: But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ? D: Um . B: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . C: A sponge . D: Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . B: Spongy . D: One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . D: So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . B: Mm-hmm . D: So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . C: Hmm . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . D: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . B: Mm . D: So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . B: So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? A: You . D: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? B: Mm . D: Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . D: On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . B: Mm . D: How do you look how does it look ? B: Mm . D: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? C: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . D: And you both agree for that ? A: And you ? B: I think we can improve on the design . C: Yeah . B: Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . C: It's it it Technical aspects . B: Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . A: Mm-hmm . B: As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . D: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? C: Yeah a three . D: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? B: Yeah . C: Uh four . D: Four . C: I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . C: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . B: Mm . D: Five with L_C_D_ and So without L_C_D_ ? C: Well five also uh Norman please . B: Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh A lot of functionalities . A: Uh For L_C_D_ . C: With lot of functionalities . B: So that is uh that is uh for both th Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them . D: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? B: Yeah . B: Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . D: With L_C_D_ . D: And without L_C_D_ ? B: Both . C: Mm for both it's the the same innovations . B: For both . B: It's the same innovation . D: Okay . B: So maybe I can put six to seven . C: six , let's go for six . A: Without L_C_D_ . B: Both . D: No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . D: So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . C: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Uh no innovative yeah . D: So we can't go I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . B: Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? B: We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? C: Talk about Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . A: So let's remove it . B: Yeah ? B: Yeah . B: Yeah but Yes exactly . D: Uh then No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . A: But This is the problem . C: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n Yeah . D: L_C_D_ ? D: Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . D: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design , so I mean So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? B: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . B: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right . C: Yeah . D: And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? C: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah I think sorry . A: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . A: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . D: So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Even then our product is going to be very good . C: Yeah , it's cheaper to produce . D: Yeah . B: Mm . B: S Yeah . C: And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so Yep . D: Yeah that's right . B: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . B: I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . B: For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . B: For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module . D: Yeah yeah that's right . B: Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . B: So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . B: User customisation is very important yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah so W uh I think it's the same . D: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? C: Six . A: Mm-hmm . D: Or you want it to be six ? C: Um six . B: Yeah . C: Yes as you say , with better uh yeah . A: Without L_C_D_ . D: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . C: And to improve the the look . D: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Mm . C: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so so let's go back to our laboratory and Yeah . B: Yeah . D: So . A: What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? B: To improve on the design . B: Huh ? A: what about the integration of speech recognition ? B: The speech recogniser is a add-on module . B: Right ? D: That's going to be an optional . D: If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . A: Ah so it's optional with the okay . D: It's an optional . B: Yeah . C: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than Yeah . A: I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it . A: Or ma yeah . A: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same Yeah . D: In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work . B: Oh . B: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . B: So we might lose the customer because of this . B: I don't know , what do you think uh ? A: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . B: Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . B: You are Marketing Manag . D: I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . A: Uh I think it inc increase . B: Yeah . D: So based on that I think But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . B: Yeah . B: But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? C: Well it's about the same because if Well you can if you had uh something li Oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh Yeah . A: I think it i increases . A: Hmm . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah . B: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . D: Yeah that's right . B: So so Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . D: I mean you could just provide with an optional . B: So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . D: So it's something like a Microsoft product update . B: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? A: And and we we we we we we don't want that . D: Updates and we sell it . D: We make updates and sell it . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , it depends on the v production . D: And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? D: Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? C: Well so Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . D: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . B: Mm . B: Mm . B: Yeah . B: What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . B: For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . D: Yeah , yeah that's right . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah that's right . B: Yeah . B: Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ? C: Sponge . D: I think you need to look into the material . B: Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . D: Yeah yeah . C: Okay . A: So Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . C: So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . D: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . A: I don't know , we have to ask these question . A: We have to give answers so Project evaluation . B: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? B: Room for creativity . B: This room is a bit small , but but I think it's okay for us to work with . D: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh I think it's okay . B: Yeah mm . C: That was good . D: This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . B: Mm . B: Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . C: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: And the leadership was excellent . A: Yeah I think so . B: Good job good job . C: Fine yes uh . A: He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . D: Yeah that's right . D: Yeah that's right . A: Uh the teamwork was very very good . C: Very democratic . A: I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you . C: Thank you . B: Thank you . A: Oh . C: Alright . B: Alright . D: And new ideas found . D: Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? B: Mm . C: Come up with new product . D: I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? A: Less fancy . B: Mm we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . C: Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . B: Mm . C: We achieved uh project goal I think . D: Yeah that is within the budget . A: De Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . B: Mm . C: It's w yes , more or less . D: And the evaluation was Yeah that's right . C: Yeah but Alright . D: And the next is celebration . C: So . D: So Yeah thank you , thank you very much . C: So uh coffee machine . A: Yeah free free coffee . C: Okay . B: Alright then , we finished ? B: Thank you very much .","summary":"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. The production costs were below budget for the basic models. The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements, and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used, which could be customized with skins. The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership, but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will look into options for spongy skin materials. The remote will feature rechargeable double-A batteries and a charging stand. The remote can be customized for adults, children, or the elderly. The remote has a misplacement reminder that sends a message to the television screen to remind users to put the remote back in the charger when not in use. The remote features a modular design that allows users to add as many or as few components as they wish to the basic model. The group was unsatisfied with the design and decided to continue working on it, focusing on a fancier design. The remote will not feature an LCD screen or voice recognition. The group decided that the teamwork and leadership of the project were good, but that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. The group had difficulty deciding what would be displayed on the LCD screen. The group felt that too much focus was placed on the functionality of the remote such that they could not achieve a fancy look. The group did not feel that the prototype met the user requirements presented by the Marketing Expert. The group could not decide how to incorporate the fashion trends into the design. Not enough information was given about the agenda of each meeting.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to review the prototypes for a new remote control design. Participants included A, the Project Manager, B who presented the prototypes, C who collaborated on the designs with Guillaume, and D, the Marketing Manager. The discussion revolved around two versions of the remote control\u2014one with an LCD display and one without, considering cost implications and user preferences. The team explored features like a microphone array, speech recognition, and modular add-ons for parental control or simplified use for older users. They debated the importance of a spongy texture and customizable skins for the remote's exterior. Financially, they aimed to keep production costs low, targeting a selling price of \u20ac25 while aiming for a production cost of around \u20ac15 for the full-featured model. Decisions were made to focus on simplicity, innovation, and user customization, with action-items including further design improvements and market research on customer preferences. The meeting concluded with positive feedback on teamwork, leadership, and the need for clearer meeting agendas, ending with plans for a celebratory coffee break.","relevance":0.5995444059,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were the two versions of the remote control discussed in the meeting?","answer":"One version had an LCD display, while the other version did not have an LCD display."},{"question":"What were some features of the remote control prototypes?","answer":"Features included a microphone array, speech recognition, detachable modules for parental control, and big buttons for older users."},{"question":"What was the target selling price for the remote control?","answer":"The target selling price was \u20ac25, with a production cost goal of around \u20ac15 for the full-featured model."},{"question":"How did the team plan to address user preferences for the remote control design?","answer":"The team aimed to focus on simplicity, innovation, and user customization, offering modular add-ons for different user needs."}]}

A: I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . A: I've prepared a little presentation . A: My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . A: Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . A: This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . A: Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . A: We'll do a little tool training with these two things . A: We'll take a look at the project plan . A: Uh there will be time for discussion . A: Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . A: And then we will close this session . A: Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . A: Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . A: Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . A: Um there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . A: But please uh don't be afraid of them . A: They won't hurt you . B: Well Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think . A: Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . A: Let's start with the ladies . B: So uh that's me . C: Okay , uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . A: Okay , so I . B: Me too . D: My name's . D: I'm uh Marketing Expert . D: My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . D: So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other . A: Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . A: That's good . A: Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . A: And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product . A: Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . A: It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . A: As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . A: Okay . A: But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . A: I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . A: Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . A: They are smart boards . A: As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . A: And uh this one here is a white board . A: I will uh instruct you about that soon . A: Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . A: Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . A: As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . A: Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . A: Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . A: Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . B: Oh . A: As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . A: Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . A: And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . A: Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . A: Um does everyone understand this nice application ? B: So we can't erase anything . D: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . A: Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . B: Right . D: S Good . A: I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . B: Alright . A: But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . A: And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . A: Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . A: It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . C: Okay . A: Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . A: Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first and um try to draw Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . C: Hmm . D: No . B: It's a sheep . D: Dinos Dinosaur . C: Seal , a seal . D: Beaver . C: A be Mm . B: A beaver . A: Well it uh could be everything . B: It's weird . C: With a tail and a mouth . A: Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , and But a turtle has . B: It has wings ? D: Turtle . C: Snail . B: Well the snail doesn't have legs . C: Okay . A: And those are slow . A: And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can . A: Okay , time for another animal . A: Would you like to go next ? C: Sure . D: No problem . D: No problem . B: Oh right . D: Mm . D: It was four months ? D: Nice , okay . B: Well . C: The hell . D: To make it a little bit easier . B: It's a giraffe . C: Make that cute . B: Or a dinosaur . D: No , it's a giraffe . D: Kay . D: I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe . B: Yes . A: Mm-hmm . B: Giraffe . D: Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . D: And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . D: So that's my favourite animal . A: Okay . D: Anything else you need to know ? A: Could you write the words , uh underneath it ? D: Oh , uh Tall . A: Or more words . C: Tall . D: So , 'kay . B: Should I uh Alright . B: So I can draw , but uh Uh . B: Well . B: Oh . C: B Bunny rabbit . D: It's a mouse . D: A bunny rabbit . B: Oh wrong one . B: Uh . B: Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope . D: Uh-huh . D: No problem . B: It's a rabbit . A: Little rabbits . B: And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess . B: That's uh my uh favourite animal . A: Okay , thank you . C: Okay . A: And our final drawing . D: Bob Ross . D: Dolphin . B: A dolphin . C: Okay , um . C: Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . C: One of the most intelligent uh animals in our world . B: Right . A: Mm-hmm . B: Well . C: Yeah intelligent . B: With an E_ . C: I've I've uh Eraser . B: You can try out the eraser now . C: Pen . C: Well not perfect , but okay . A: Okay , well thank you very much . A: I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , huh ? B: Not really . A: Well , nice animals , nice words . A: Sounds good . A: Um back to business , back to the money part . A: Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . A: And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . A: And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . A: Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . A: I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . A: Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . A: Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . A: What's your experience with remote control ? C: A lot of buttons . B: I always lose them . D: Yeah . C: And you always lose them . B: Yes . C: A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Complex . B: Yeah . C: Not user friendly . D: No . B: search for the buttons , which one is which and uh Well . D: No . D: Boring . A: Boring , it's not fun to use a remote . D: No . C: Mm . D: Black , all black . A: Mm-hmm . D: So , yeah . C: Black colours . A: Well maybe we should try to make it fun . D: Mm-hmm . C: They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . C: Uh . D: The the angle you have to use . B: Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . D: You had different remote controls for different devices . C: Yeah , different remote controls , yeah . B: Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something . D: Yes . C: Uh for the use of different uh devices . B: Yes . D: Yeah . B: Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh . A: Mm-hmm . B: Perhaps that's an idea . D: Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , so Flap yeah . B: Yeah , that's right . C: Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . B: And which you don't use . B: Right . D: Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control . C: That's possible , so that you only get the No n n no , just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . B: Yeah . B: You should just give it to . D: Mm-hmm . C: Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . B: Changing channel . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . C: Or uh the numbers , of course . D: numbers . C: But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . D: On and off . C: You only use those uh the first time , or . D: Yeah , play , pause , stop . C: So . C: Uh . A: Mm-hmm . A: So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . C: Yeah , I think so , yeah . B: Yes . B: But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . D: Mm-hmm , of course . B: Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , w what's the name ? C: Yeah , uh teletext . A: Mm-hmm . C: think so . C: Okay . A: So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat . D: No . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: But But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . C: Right . D: Because I think a market will be all kind of people . D: Elderly p el elderly , young people , so . B: I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh And the B_B_C_ . C: Uh . D: Yeah I think that's the better one , because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think . C: Yeah I I understand . B: Yes . C: No . B: Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . D: I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , we can leave that . C: When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly . D: Not that much . C: So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . D: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Standard deliver . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm . C: So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . C: You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . C: In those in that Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . D: No but Yeah . B: Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . D: Yeah , th it it's I think that's not Yeah , okay . B: That's not Yeah , that's right . C: It's impossible . C: Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . D: No . B: Yeah that's uh . C: Uh Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . D: I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . B: Well not everywhere . D: So I think numerals . C: Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . D: Yeah , but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . B: Yeah , you can choose the code . D: You can use which which type of television you have . C: Okay . C: Okay . D: That's no problem . C: Okay . D: But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think . C: Okay , but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not uh optional for those uh people . D: Simplicity . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . D: Yeah g available . B: But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke . D: True . C: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . C: So we should take that in consideration . B: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , well any more ideas ? C: Oh mm , no . D: Of course . A: No ? B: Guess not . C: Things'll come up . D: Yeah . A: Okay , yeah well we have some time . A: Let's see what more I have to tell you . A: I don't think there is much left . A: Nope . A: We're starting to close . A: Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . A: In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . A: Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . A: And there's a ping . A: Is it my laptop ? D: Yeah . A: Yep . C: Stop the meeting now . A: Ah well that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . B: Yeah meeting will close in five minutes . C: Okay . A: Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . A: The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . A: And this was the Interface Designer ? A: Or the Interaction Designer . B: Hmm hmm . C: Mm . A: Or what was it , I_D_ ? B: No interface . C: No ? D: Interface . A: Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . A: Uh will take a look at the the working design . C: No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay . B: No the Yeah . A: Industrial Designer , okay , sorry . C: Okay . A: Let's just use the acronyms . B: So So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really Right . A: Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . A: Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , I hope . B: Alright . B: Me too . A: And of course you have your own uh expertise . A: Well uh that was what I had to say . D: Uh-huh . A: Uh are there any more questions ? C: Okay . D: No . C: No . A: No ? A: Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working . D: I have one question . C: Okay . A: Okay , one question ? C: Oh . D: Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed She didn't know who . D: Okay , no , no problem . A: Okay we're still going . C: No problem . D: No problem . A: Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . C: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: Alright . A: Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes , then . C: Alrighty . B: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Thank you very much . B: Yeah .

A: I haven't And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . D: Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies E_I_E_ . C: So . C: Huh ? C: Okay , um Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . A: Thank you . C: It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . C: Um well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . C: Uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . A: Sorry . C: Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . C: Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . C: You know what a let is ? B: Yeah . C: Okay . C: And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . C: Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . C: That's basically uh how it works . C: Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . C: Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . C: Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . B: Oh right . D: Animation . C: we tel There . B: There is something turning . A: Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board . C: Okay . C: Uh well the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . C: Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh Yes , uh , okay . D: Infrared light . C: Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . C: Okay . C: S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . C: Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . C: Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . C: But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . B: Yeah , I've got it there too . C: And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . C: Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . C: And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . B: Yeah . C: Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh two of these this meeting . D: To this meeting . A: Okay , thank you . B: Shall I go uh next ? A: Yep . C: So . B: Kay . A: Please . B: So . D: Smoking . B: Well uh , my name's , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . B: Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . B: Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . B: And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . B: Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . B: There are some uh examples of remote controls . B: You can see they are very different . B: The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . B: And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . B: And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . B: Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . B: A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . B: Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . B: But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? B: Because all the T_V_s will have them . B: Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . B: And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . B: If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . B: The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . B: And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . B: And that is my presentation . A: Okay , thank you . C: Okay . D: Kay . D: Check . B: You must still have it open . D: Kijke 'Kay , so . D: We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just Yeah , and the users , actually . D: The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . D: Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? D: And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . D: Okay . D: Some data . D: Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . D: And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . D: The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . D: Goed so . C: Hmm . D: Kay . D: Findings . D: Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . D: So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . B: Yeah . D: Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . C: Mm . D: Next . D: Important issues about the remote . D: I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . D: Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . D: The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . D: And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . D: It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . D: My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden okay . C: Mm . B: Hmm . D: So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . D: Buttons . D: Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . D: or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . D: L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . D: Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . D: And you don't see the buttons . D: So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . D: So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . C: Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? D: Yeah , touch screen , yeah . C: Okay . D: The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . D: Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . D: And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . B: Mm . C: Kay . D: So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . D: And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . D: And it should be easy to use . D: Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . D: And that is it . C: Okay . A: Okay , thank you . B: Oh right . A: Um , well thank you all , huh . A: I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? B: No . A: No ? A: Well , then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them . B: Res I did not . C: No . B: Perhaps the rest ? D: Ja , Be television . A: Oh , well not in this presentation . A: Hmm . A: Should be in there . A: Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . A: Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . B: Oh . A: So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . A: Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . A: Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . A: And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . A: So we have to keep that in mind . A: Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . B: Mm . A: So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? B: Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? B: Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? A: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Only be used for television . B: And the video also , or not uh ? D: Only the television . A: Well it says only for television here , huh . B: Oh . B: Alright . B: Okay . A: Makes it a lot easier , huh ? B: Yeah . C: Mm . D: So yeah , then you can yeah . D: Requirements , no ? D: Functions . A: Mm-hmm . B: Then it should have uh on , off , and uh Yeah . C: Yeah for Standby options , yeah ? D: Yeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , oh teletext doesn't have to be ? C: Uh yeah . B: And per perhaps uh No . D: Um other functions . B: Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . D: Yeah I had Yeah , yeah . C: Two s two two digits , oh okay . B: Can you Don't know if that's got a name , but Yeah . C: Yeah I understand what you mean . D: I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed to user . C: Yeah . C: It makes it twelve , yeah . C: Indeed . B: S Yeah . C: Okay . C: Well , not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . C: So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . D: Yeah . D: So that it easy and fast . C: But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Uh yeah , think so . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , so you should have that one on . D: Our main targets' age are ? D: were ? D: Forty five plus , or ? B: Mute misschien also . C: Mm . A: Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . D: Forties , okay because because younger people as Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . D: From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . D: You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . C: Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . D: With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again . C: Yeah , we we could yeah . C: But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . C: Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . D: Yeah , okay . D: Yeah but a you don't know True . C: A touch screen uh probably uh even more . B: An But , do you But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? C: So , true , true . C: But uh Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ? D: Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . D: Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . C: So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . D: And if the only f Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five . C: Yeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh Is it possible to find out , anyway ? D: Yeah you don't know how much it costs . D: Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . D: No , I don't have any costs here , I only have percentages . C: You know ? B: Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . D: Yeah . C: No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . C: Um just uh displays several buttons , for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . B: Yeah ? B: Oh right , so you can Oh , yeah alright . B: So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . D: Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone . C: Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah . C: Yeah yeah . B: Yeah alright , oh right . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? B: Yeah . D: I think it's the most easier thing , yeah . B: Would be yeah . C: That's my uh Yeah . A: And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . D: No . B: Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? D: Yeah . C: Twelve fifty . B: Yeah . B: I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is . C: Um . B: Any guesses ? C: Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . D: Highly . A: Mm-hmm . C: And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls Yeah . B: Yeah . B: But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? D: Yeah , but Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . D: But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . B: Oh , so still a little bit people Yeah that's right . B: But you don't want to alienate the other uh But if they also buy it then it's alright . D: No , that not now , but , so Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . B: I guess . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Alright . A: Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ? B: An Yes . C: Mm . A: Okay . C: It's treasure . A: And what else ? C: I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales . D: Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . D: N nothing , no costs at all . B: Yeah . C: Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder . B: But perhaps later , so uh Yeah . D: Yeah , in I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything . B: I don't Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive . C: Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert . D: Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it . C: I uh Yeah sure , sure . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , okay . A: But for now it's L_C_D_ . D: Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . B: The L_C_D_ ? D: Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . B: Oh that's a bit of a problem . B: Oh , that's a bit of a problem . C: Mm . D: Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . C: It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen . B: Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: They think it's ugly . B: When it has an L_C_D_ screen . D: Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . B: Oh , alright , I thought that you said that . D: So Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , of course . C: Mm yeah . D: And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . C: And then not yeah . C: Um . D: Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Mm . C: Okay ? A: Okay , what else does our remote need ? D: Um Mm-hmm . B: A mute button . A: Mute button . B: I think . D: The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . B: And Yeah . C: Yeah . D: And a teletext , but that is not of the question . B: But But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? D: Other things are Sorry ? D: Yeah , it could be . B: Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . D: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . D: Yeah , teletext . C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: And there's also a A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . D: And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but Less important . B: Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , or not ? D: Yeah , should be there , but not press Yeah , sub-menu , yeah . C: Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure . A: Mm-hmm . B: Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah . C: Indeed . C: So uh you can mount uh the the the uh uh the remote control to um to refill the Yeah . D: Yeah , in a breath it's Charted . A: Mm-hmm . B: We should think of the twelve fifty we have but I don't know how much that's going to uh Yeah . D: Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , so Yeah . C: Okay , because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast . D: Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things . B: You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . C: Yeah . B: If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . C: Yeah , yeah . C: Yeah . B: You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh I don't know . A: Mm-hmm . C: Uh And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that Yeah , automatically . D: Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . B: Nee that's that's uh yeah . B: But then you can't Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it yeah . D: Yeah . C: After two minutes or three minutes , something like that . D: After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: And maybe a low battery indicator ? C: Yeah . A: On the screen . C: Sure . D: Yeah . D: And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . C: Yeah . D: Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . C: Mm . D: Charger . A: So we are going for the for the recharger . C: Yeah . D: Yeah , if it's . A: Okay . D: Uh . B: If it's sensible . D: Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , and I don't think it Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , b when the batteries are low But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember . C: No , when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it Yeah sure , of course . D: Yeah , then you have a problem . C: Yeah , but But you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so I Yeah . B: Yeah . B: That's right . B: Yeah . D: Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . D: So . B: Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , or not ? D: Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen . B: Cause Yeah , that's right , but Yeah . D: High power usage . C: High power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . D: Yes . C: Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions . D: True . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: True . B: Right . D: Yeah , you made a point there . C: Okay . B: But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . A: Yeah , also . D: Yeah , otherwise all your yeah . D: Just a small device . B: Yeah . C: Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big . D: Plug it in , that's it . B: I think everything has it for and I guess . D: Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something . C: Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Something like that , just u Okay . B: Yeah . B: Alright . A: Okay , well I've Yeah , you have some more points . D: It has to be easy to use also , or things . D: Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition . D: I think . C: Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify . D: Also . D: Well I think that this should be standard . D: Large button large buttons . D: Yeah ? D: Okay . C: Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . C: Okay . A: And you said something about speech recognition ? D: Yeah , it says also Yeah . C: Speech recognition ? C: Hello . C: Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty . B: Yeah , twelve fifty , twelve fifty . D: Twelve . D: That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . B: So it's pretty big . C: Well , spread it by a big market . D: But then I I I Yeah . A: Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . B: Yeah . B: W I know let's do a speech . C: Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to Yeah Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Ninety . D: Twenty five . B: You can clap or something . D: channel . C: Turn volume up . B: Yeah . C: Hey , that that's an idea . B: Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno . D: Yeah . C: Okay , well that should it has to be remote control , not Yeah . D: Yeah , twelve . B: But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , or ? D: Yeah . C: Sure why not why not Yeah , mm . D: Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . D: It's the only thing it says . B: Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ? D: I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient . C: Yeah . A: But when you look at the percentages Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? D: Yeah , it says a lot , but No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . C: Perhaps the options should be uh Why not ? A: Yeah , well , maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . C: Why not ? B: Yeah . C: Let's hope uh to have some uh d We should do it . B: I know Mm . D: So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . A: But would it be useful to imple implement both ? D: Yeah , if the costs al allow it . A: On one remote ? B: Well I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . A: Or Yeah , I dunno . D: Nee . B: With that uh Yeah , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ? D: If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Sure . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Uh . C: Certain systems already exist , I think . D: Mm-hmm . B: Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . B: Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English and Yeah , that's right . D: True . C: True , yeah . D: Yeah . D: True . C: Yeah . D: But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . C: This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . C: Yeah . D: Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something . B: Yeah . C: Right . C: Swahili . B: Yeah you can use icons for the a speaker and uh But if that's better than language for the for the remote . C: Swahili . C: Yeah . D: Ja , well possible . C: Indeed . D: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . C: Yeah . C: So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay . B: Then it's Yeah . C: Okay . D: Kay , what else ? A: So , no speech recognition ? A: Or Yeah , and then we have different languages . B: Well , if it could be done , we Yeah . D: Yeah , we have to keep Yeah . C: Y it should be done . C: If it could be done , should be done . B: Yeah , that should be uh anything matters . C: That's not so difficult at all , because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to uh not all , but Yeah , sure , indeed . A: Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . B: Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing . D: I think it's difficult . D: Every language of dialects I think it's very differen difficult . B: Yeah . B: And you have to speak the so that it can understand . D: Yeah . D: I think it can't be implemented , but maybe Yeah , 's an option , yes . B: You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . D: Fifty Euro cents . B: Yeah . B: Let's do speech . D: Yeah . C: For speech recognition . B: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . A: Um or from zero to nine . A: Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . A: Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . B: Mm . A: And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general . D: Mm , yes . B: Yeah . B: I With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but You also now have colours . D: No , but Curved ? B: I don't know if we should implement that . B: Yeah , when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport . C: Uh yeah . D: Um . C: S Shortcuts . C: Uh . D: I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . B: Yeah . C: Mm . D: D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . D: And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . C: Sh Yeah , just just sub-menu . D: It should be available but not not Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Cause it should be there . C: Not directly uh available . D: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ? D: Yeah . C: Mm . B: So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . D: Yeah , but s Yeah . C: Directly available . C: So does it confuse uh the user ? B: You'll have to search for it . D: They'd have to be easy to use . C: Uh . C: I'll search um . C: If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , that's a I guess not . D: The sign of it . D: Uh , no . C: No . D: What else can you do with a television ? B: We've got anon Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing . A: Aren't we forgetting something very important ? D: Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . B: Well , we don't have the video orders Yeah , you could look here all the the Uh th th th th I don't know , technical functions . D: Yes , so this is your presentation . D: We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . D: Which ones were yours ? D: Techni Ja ja ja ja ja . B: They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because I guess we've got them all . A: Ping . D: Technical functions . D: Yeah okay . D: Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I Yeah . D: Very slow . D: Yeah , the zoom buttons . B: And for a T_V_ ? D: Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , yeah different uh Yeah . B: Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? B: Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . B: But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . C: Menu . D: Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . B: Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings . C: Mm . D: Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . B: Oh right . B: Yeah . D: Channel settings . B: Yeah , so you can program the Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh Yeah . D: So those four , and of course the main . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Like tap screens or something or , I dunno . B: I hope we can do this . D: Something Yeah , if uh No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it . C: There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . C: Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations Yeah . D: Mm-hmm . B: We don't have to use that top . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: So you leave it alone . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . B: Yeah . B: And do we want them in different colours , or And and the buttons , should they have colours ? D: Yeah . D: Colours . D: Yeah . C: Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . B: Oh but we don't have any buttons . B: Yeah . C: I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo Adjust with phones , yes Okay . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , then defines itself . D: Because uh how many percent ? D: Eighty percent ? B: They think it's ugly , right ? D: Would spend more money if it looks fancy . B: Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . B: You can uh But I don't think that uh Yeah . C: Twelve Euro fifty . C: Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? C: Sure . D: Yeah . C: Red , white , blue , black . D: Rasta colours . A: And a see-through uh Okay , well that's the signal for las final five minutes . C: Grey . C: Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and Leave . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , see through version . D: Yeah . D: If you press a button , it turns green . B: Yeah . B: A disco version . B: Five minutes ? A: Um so I have uh the things I just read . A: Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? C: Yeah . D: Channel settings ? B: Oh yeah , right . A: Channel settings . B: So you can program the T_V_ . D: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Mm . B: Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . B: So , options , and then you sub them . D: Yeah . B: Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but Yeah , but I Yeah . D: Could be possible . C: Mm . D: Or like uh you have a menu button , you press Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . A: No , we said teletext also a separate menu . B: Yeah . A: Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess . B: But I don't know . D: Yeah , no problem . A: So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? D: Yep . A: Like uh large icons or small icons and I don't know what else , but Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ? D: Um , I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons Yeah , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button . C: No . B: Or do we have any buttons ? B: On the remote . B: Which one ? D: Those buttons you can you can Yeah . B: But that's also in the L_C_D_ , right ? A: Right , yeah , okay . D: Yeah , th No , no normal buttons , yeah . B: So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No , alright . D: Maybe only the on and o on and off button . B: Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno No , no . A: But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . C: Uh not button Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . D: But I don't think Mm , no . A: Okay . B: Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . B: If you have if you have uh Yeah . B: But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah . D: No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . D: Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . D: No . A: Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . A: So how do you turn the thing on ? A: There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ? B: No you just tap I think . D: Yeah , you tap . C: Just tap it . D: Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on . A: Tap the thing . A: Okay . A: And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? D: No , just the remote . D: A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . A: Sure . B: But Yeah a yeah . C: Yeah , it should be in standby mode , but A A A normal button on the remote control , or norm ? D: Or not . B: I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . D: Separate . B: Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's Yeah , yeah . B: To turn it on . B: Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . C: Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . B: Yeah , I have , yeah . A: Okay , well Yeah . C: Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? B: Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . B: But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . D: Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . C: Mm . B: Oh right . C: I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . B: Yeah , I think so too . B: Otherwise y wet e k Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . B: Yeah . A: No buttons at all . A: Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . D: Mm-hmm . B: If we can afford it . A: Okay , well I guess we have to postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . D: Yeah , if we can afford it . D: Yeah . C: Oh , okay Oh . A: Um for now , we're having a lunch break , and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . A: I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . A: And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . C: Mm . A: And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . A: And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . B: Alright . A: Luckily as we are . A: Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? D: Mm-hmm . B: Lunch . C: Okay . C: Food . B: Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ? C: Yeah , think so . B: Yeah .","summary":"After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip. The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people. The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people. The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions. The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board The remote will not include a pen. The remote will use rechargeable batteries which recharge in a docking station. The remote will use a chip on print. The case will be single curved. The case will be made of rubber. The remote will contain a microphone for speech recognition. The remote will have a scrolling device. What shape the remote should be. Whether to use hard or soft rubber. Whether to include a pen to use with the touchscreen on the remote. What sort of batteries to use. Whether the remote requires a CPU. Position of buttons. Position of a microphone on the remote. Color of remote.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, the project manager cum secretary led the team through a series of presentations on remote control design. Each team member, including Denni, shared insights on technical functions, working designs, and user preferences. The discussions revolved around the practicalities of remote control operation, such as button mechanisms and the potential for an LCD screen. They delved into the demographics of user preferences, with a focus on age groups and features like speech recognition. The team debated the inclusion of various functions like teletext, screen settings, and audio controls, considering the balance between complexity and user-friendliness. Financial constraints were a concern, with a budget of \u20ac12.50 per unit influencing decisions on features like LCD screens and speech recognition. The meeting concluded with plans for further individual work and the creation of a button-less remote control, potentially a unique selling point. Action items included exploring the feasibility of different features and designs, with specific instructions to be provided by personal coaches. The team adjourned for lunch, ready to reconvene for more detailed discussions and decision-making in the future.","relevance":0.3729627132,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What were some of the key topics discussed during the functional design meeting?","answer":"The team discussed remote control design, technical functions, user preferences, demographics, and financial constraints."},{"question":"What were some of the features considered for the remote control design?","answer":"Features considered included button mechanisms, LCD screens, speech recognition, teletext, screen settings, and audio controls."},{"question":"What was the budget constraint mentioned during the meeting?","answer":"The budget per unit was set at \u20ac12.50, influencing decisions on features like LCD screens and speech recognition."},{"question":"What was the unique selling point proposed for the remote control design?","answer":"The team proposed creating a button-less remote control, potentially as a unique selling point."}]}
{"meeting_id":"TS3005c","dialogue":"A: Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . A: I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . A: Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . A: Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . A: Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . A: And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . A: Okay , well I'd say let's start with the first presentation . D: Kay . A: Um in the same order as last time ? C: W sure . B: Mm . A: Okay . B: Alright . A: Well , take it away . C: Okay uh welcome you all . C: Components design , um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . C: I I elaborated on the concept . C: What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . C: Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . C: Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . C: I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . D: Don't destroy my giraffe . C: Giraffe's gone now . C: Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . C: There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . D: Drop it . B: Hmm . C: But uh it's a very expensive material . C: Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . C: Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . C: Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . C: Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . C: Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . C: But it's a very strong material . C: Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . C: Uh so it's t two dimensional . C: I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green . B: It's a colour . D: Bright colour . C: Uh New . D: Fancy colour . D: Forward . C: Blank . C: Okay . D: You have to go t Oh it's a side view . C: Let's make it uh black . C: Okay . C: I thought of an idea like this . C: Oh that . C: Um delete . C: Blank . C: Okay . C: So it also looks nice when it's on your table . C: So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . C: Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , but . C: Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . C: Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . C: Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . C: One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . C: And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . C: Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . D: True . C: So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . C: Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . C: Questions , ? D: No no no no no . B: No . C: Okay . D: Just looking . C: And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . C: And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . C: Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . C: Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . C: That was correct , wasn't it ? A: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . A: Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour , but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . C: Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ? C: Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? A: It must be recognisable . C: Okay okay . C: Well that's possible of course . C: We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . B: You can put the R_ and R_ . C: Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . C: And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . C: Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . C: And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . C: Okay . C: Well that's all about my uh my findings . B: Alright . A: Okay , thank you . D: Mm mm mm . B: I will go next . D: Next . B: Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . B: Uh how it should look . B: And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . B: And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . B: Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . B: And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . B: And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . B: And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . C: Mm . B: This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . C: Mm . B: Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . A: Mm . C: Mm . D: It's true . B: And perhaps we could uh implement that . B: And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw , so uh don't make too much of it . C: Oh my God . B: I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . B: I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . B: I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but yeah . C: Not just a P_ . D: P_ yeah , just a P_ . C: Oh okay . B: So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . C: .. . B: Um . D: Where's where's the button for two ? B: I forgot that one . D: Okay . B: I thought I forgot something , but uh . B: And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . C: Ah . D: Doesn't matter . B: Um an options button . B: And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . C: Mm-hmm . B: It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . D: No . C: Yep . B: So could call it settings or something . B: But this is a bit uh how I thought it . B: And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . B: Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something uh . C: Oh okay , yeah . B: But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . B: Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . C: Oh yeah , . B: And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . B: And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . B: So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . A: Mm-hmm . C: Mm . C: Okay . B: That's an option . B: And that was my uh finding dinge . A: Thanks . B: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Now our third team member with his presentation . C: Go Danny , go Danny . D: Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . D: The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . D: Kay . D: The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . D: So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . D: Findings I made . D: The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . D: The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . D: And the third thing is it should be easy to use . D: I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . D: The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . C: Fruity ? C: Fruity . B: Grass green . D: Yeah . D: Like that . D: The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . C: Mm . D: It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . C: Okay . B: Let's build it into a sponge . D: Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . D: They liked square shapes with round edges . D: And hard materials like wood , um titanium . D: They those kind of materials they liked . D: This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . D: And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something . A: Oh y So for the older people , a more traditional uh form . D: It's it's a bit like a banana . D: And the colour should be yellow , or something . D: And for the elderly people just plain old . D: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? B: It was one remote , I think , different colours . D: Different colours , yeah . D: We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . D: I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . D: Simple but easy to use . C: Mm . D: So that's it . C: Okay . D: That is my Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe Yeah . B: You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . B: I don't know which shape you should should take , but . D: Colours th the elderly people Uh Look something like that . A: Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh the shape of it . B: Yeah . C: Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? B: Perhaps you could find something in the middle . C: Yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah . B: Round but square . B: Yeah . A: But maybe then both groups won't buy it . C: Yeah . B: Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ? C: Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a . B: wait , like like this uh a bit . C: Yeah . B: So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . C: Kinda like a beer glass . B: So but then Same sides . C: Yeah . C: I know what you mean . C: It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . B: But that's uh Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . C: Yeah . B: People know the Yeah . C: Will recognise that's as a remote control . C: Uh when I saw your d Oh . D: Autumn colours like red , brown . D: They liked the wood a lot . C: Huh . A: Mm-hmm . D: So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh Let's put it all together . D: And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . B: Yeah . B: Swords . D: Those kind of Yeah , those kind of things . D: So you see the big difference between the young people ? D: Fresh , exciting . B: Yeah . D: And the old people , old and boring . B: But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . D: So Sorry ? B: That's easy to do with the colours , I think . D: Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . B: Yeah . C: Uh . D: Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . A: Yeah we think so too . D: In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . B: Yeah think uh Also in between . D: Or something something between that . C: Soft rubber . D: Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it . C: Yeah I know what you Um . B: I don't think you should be able to mould it , but Yeah . D: Or No . D: Or or wh what's something harder . C: It should shouldn't be . D: No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . D: That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder . C: Uh . B: Bit like this kind of rubber . B: This uh But it's quite hard , this . D: Yeah , something like this , yeah . D: Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . B: Yeah . D: It's feels kind s spongy . C: Spongy . A: Hmm . D: Something . B: I don't think it's rubber . D: No . D: N n n Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . A: So we need a spongy feeling . B: Uh did you have something about uh So we should first decide about shape , I think . C: Yeah . C: Ding ding . B: Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh . C: Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . D: Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like Yeah three quarter of the of the Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is Mm-hmm . C: Um . B: Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah . C: .. . C: This was your size , but I think it should be larger . C: Yeah , three quarters . C: So uh so you don't have to put your oh . C: Uh new , blank . C: So uh when you get this uh Uh kinda like this . B: Ooh Yeah . C: Or should it be larger ? D: Larger I think . C: Larger ? C: Because you want to put your hands You want Yeah . B: But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . D: Yeah becau because you have Yeah okay , true , true , true true . B: Perhaps that's best . C: Your thumb here . B: But not on the screen because Yeah that's uh that's an idea . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . C: Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . B: You always touch it , yeah . D: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . C: Going to be very greasy and stuff . D: But it won't get that small because you have how much ? D: Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . B: Yeah . D: One to zero , the two digit , You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . C: Yeah you don't want it too small . C: How yeah how large Yeah they have thick fingers . C: But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands and we got these large Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . D: Yeah true , but Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ? C: You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , right ? D: No . D: Yeah . C: Your fingers , yeah . D: Yeah . C: You don't want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth . A: Yeah . B: Y you could include a pen . D: Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen . A: Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . D: Yeah the fingers , yeah . B: Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen . B: Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . B: I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something . B: Yeah . D: Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue . D: Yeah , you can buy those at Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station . A: Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . C: Sure . A: So we can discuss these points . A: those points um energy question mark . A: How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . A: Uh chip on print and case . A: Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . B: I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah . C: The docking station . A: Yeah . A: So that's the the the first point . A: We already decided that on the previous meeting . C: W Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: So if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them . A: Mm-hmm . B: Just like with the telephone . C: I kinda like your Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? D: Yeah yeah yeah like those . C: Mouse . C: Computer mouse . C: Kinda like those kind of batteries . D: Yep . B: but it should be th I think normal batteries , not not like two or two uh Yeah . D: Yeah , normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . C: Yeah . A: Simple rechargeable uh batteries . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . B: Um what was with the chip on print ? C: The chip on print ? C: Um Uh you gotta f Yeah . C: I think so . C: Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a We also discussed that . D: Print plate . C: Didn't we ? A: Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? A: You still have a print plate . C: Uh Beg your pardon ? D: Yeah yeah yeah . D: You always have a print plate . D: You always have a print plate , right ? C: Yeah sure , of course , yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Always , so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . A: Yeah well it's a good question . A: It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it , but Mm-hmm . C: Well uh chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . C: But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . D: Yeah , okay . D: But Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think . B: Yeah . C: When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the Yeah . A: Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . C: I suppose so . D: Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . C: It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't Yeah because it has to uh b Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . D: Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . D: I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . D: Yeah , okay , true true . D: True . C: So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . A: Mm-hmm . A: Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . C: Yeah . C: And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . A: Yeah . C: And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and uh Uh hard rubber I think . B: It's rubber . B: Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ? B: Or softer rubber or Yeah . C: That's the easy to ha uh to to uh Yeah . D: Yeah . B: It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . C: Yeah sure , look . D: We have different colours . B: Yeah yeah this in different colours ? D: So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? C: D It's our main target . D: No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . B: Yeah it's a bit . B: But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . D: So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: But that's what we want , . B: I think so too . D: Yeah , that's our target . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Lower than forty years , I think it was . C: Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? D: Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good Yeah . C: So i Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course . B: Yeah . A: Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . B: Yeah . C: Uh . D: You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . A: So Okay so Yeah but I wrote it down . C: Because it Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , that's a good idea . C: It's a lot easier . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , alright . D: So You can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the And load it on the the user the server . C: So , so you got uh Did you write that down ? B: And then Yeah , you can uh It's pretty easy but And Yeah , I had what I just uh I should again . C: Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured remote control . C: Yeah . A: What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . A: You you showed your drawing . B: I miss a few buttons , but . B: Well . B: At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . D: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , you have to go back . D: Yeah uh uh . B: This I don't know . D: Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? D: With the minus and the plus . B: I think it's I don't know . D: I think it's easier than Yeah . B: I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think . C: Sorry ? B: Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? A: Mm . D: For sound and channel . C: Depends on the screen . B: Th Right well if we make it like this , I think if you put it like this Yeah . C: If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . C: If you make it uh in a rectangle I so it's it's it's it's Square . D: Yeah . D: I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . D: A minus here , plus over here . C: Oh , okay . D: And on here . D: The other buttons and on here the top . D: The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , and the sound . B: Yeah . B: But I think I wou I think that's a matter of what you're used to . D: Something uh Something like Sh Plus minus plus uh minus . B: I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . B: And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . C: Uh . C: Take your time . B: Almost . B: Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . D: Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . B: Yeah but I think Yeah I don't know . B: Perhaps I have some examples . C: W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . B: I don't know That's me . D: Who's the usability engineering ? D: She is . B: But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . D: Oh . B: The 'Cause they can use that better . C: Yeah . D: Um Oh I have that those s numbers . C: Consistency . B: Yeah . B: I Here is our here are uh I don't really know . D: Or a good watch . D: B Channel selection . A: Everybody's searching in his data . B: Yeah . D: Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . D: Volume selection four times an hour Uh Yeah , that depends on on on the remote . B: Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . C: Yeah . C: So not how much n not how often it's used , but Uh . B: W what's what's usual or normal . B: Yes I'm looking here . B: But here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other . B: I think it's it's a Yeah . D: I think because I have two televisions at home . D: One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . C: Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , but Uh . D: Yeah . D: Depends . B: I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . D: Yeah , lower . B: And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . D: True . B: That's how it's is usually when I look here that's what I see . C: Okay , um . C: Let's cut to the chase . D: It's got to change . A: Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts . B: I don't know . D: Yeah is it is user interface . B: Yeah . D: Component . B: This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a And the speech uh shall we implement that ? C: Okay , well le Yeah . C: Interface , yeah . B: Or uh Yeah . A: Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? D: Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here . C: Technologies , uh . C: Yeah . C: Makes it possible to Mm . B: But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . D: Yeah . B: You can talk into the corner . D: Yeah , a microphone , yeah . B: Yeah . C: Not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . A: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh over there . B: But Yeah , that's also . C: Yeah . C: Right . B: So , in the middle or something . C: But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . A: Yeah , yeah . B: but you should uh decide where you want to put it . C: Ah okay , sure , okay , well tha Underneath ? B: Right ? D: Um I think where it isn't seen the most . C: Indeed . C: It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . D: Inside . B: You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . A: Yeah . C: Yeah sure , why no Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh Uh . D: Yeah . A: Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . D: I i between the round of the R_ . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , okay . B: So where do you want to put it ? A: Well maybe where the one hand But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? B: Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it . D: Yeah . D: Yeah bu but I think the left s under corner should be the best . B: It's a way for you to uh So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that . C: Yeah , okay . B: About a microphone , there is no button . A: Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote . B: Yeah . D: Where isn't i it isn't most in sight . B: Yeah . C: Okay . D: I think . C: Well put it there . C: I don't mind . C: That doesn't doesn't really matter . D: No . D: Actually doesn't . C: Okay . B: Alright . C: So ? B: Any more uh Yeah . A: So well uh type , supplements , anything . C: Interface type . A: Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ and Mm-hmm . C: The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah . D: I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . B: Yeah . D: I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . D: If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . B: Yeah . C: Hey , . B: Um yeah . B: Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah . C: Use the scroll . D: Yeah ? C: Yeah I think so too . D: You do like it ? C: So why not , on on side . B: Or at least Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something . C: Fast , yeah . D: Yeah I think it is is faster . C: So if you've got a settings , if you Yes . D: Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , but if you don't have a lot of option then Y Uh-huh . C: You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . D: Yeah , okay , true . B: Yeah . C: So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . D: Okay . C: Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . D: Okay , no problem . A: And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . B: It's also different . C: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Okay . A: Well there's our five minutes uh warning . A: Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? D: Um . D: No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear . A: Everybody think they can can work for that ? C: Okay , what's the standard colour ? D: And a standard , yeah we don't no we have different colour . A: Is there a standard colour ? C: I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour . D: How many colours are we going to Black . B: You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard . D: Yeah , black I think is is the standard . C: Black ? C: With the with the yellow uh Just a regular uh remote colour . B: But if you want to be different , then uh Silver . D: Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . D: Yeah like like yeah . C: And then have uh different covers uh to use . D: Or or silver . D: I think it's better to have silver nowadays . C: Silver , yeah . D: I think you see more silver than black . A: Yeah . C: You see a lot of t uh silver televisions . A: But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional , so uh Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy . B: Silver rubber . D: Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . D: Yeah . D: I think we have silver , black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . C: Yeah y I think it's better to Yeah th yeah . D: Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have . D: R red . B: But yeah . C: That's right . D: Green , wood , brown . C: But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . D: Yeah . D: True . C: When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . B: Yeah . C: Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine . A: Mm-hmm . C: Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . B: Yeah . C: You understand ? D: Yeah , I understand . A: Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just Yeah . D: Yeah o of course . C: Yeah . D: The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown . C: Fruity . B: Just all kind of colour . C: Fruity loops . A: Mm-hmm . A: Maroon . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Okay , so Who's pinging ? B: And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh Is it Yeah . D: No . A: You are pingin Okay . C: You ping . A: I thought we Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? A: Everybody knows uh what to do ? A: Well I wrote it down here . C: Well not what to do . B: Well I don't know what to do , but . A: I wrote it down here what to do um . C: Not what to do . C: Look . A: The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . C: Okay . A: Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . B: Ooh . B: Right . D: S tough . B: Yeah . D: We'll be available . B: But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we Right . A: Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . B: Yes . A: I don't know . B: Okay . C: Thin I think we should work . A: Okay well that was what I had to say , uh , final thoughts from anyone , or ? B: Yeah I think . B: No . D: No . A: We're finished . A: Okay , well thank you very much . B: Yeah . D: Finished . C: Thank you very much . B: So we have to keep talking English now ?","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator. The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype. The team found the remote to be fancy, innovative, fairly easy to use, available in different colors, fairly spongy, difficult to misplace, and targeted to younger people. The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote. The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design. The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process. The team found the project stressful, the equipment useful, the information available to them lacking, and their laptops to be slow and heavy. The team members will go to their own rooms. The project manager will create a final report The remote uses a conventional battery. The remote will not use a sample speaker and feature speech recognition. The remote will use an advanced chip. The case will be single curved. The case is made of rubber. The remote will not feature a scroll wheel. Size of microphone. Color options for the remote. Whether the remote appeals to younger people. Whether LCD screens and microphones are components or features. Whether to lose the curvature in the design of the remote case. Whether to keep the speech recognition component. Whether to use a different material other than rubber. Whether to make a remote out of wood or to make a remote with different colors. Whether to lose the scroll wheel. What colors to make the remote in.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the conceptual design meeting, A led the team through a detailed discussion involving C presenting on component design, advocating for rubber casing due to its durability and aesthetic flexibility, while D shared insights on trends, highlighting the importance of a fancy, innovative, and user-friendly design. B followed with thoughts on the interface, proposing an LCD screen with speech recognition technology and sketching out potential layouts. The team debated button placement for volume and channel controls, considering user habits and preferences. A raised key decision points on energy supply, chip integration, and casing material, with the team leaning towards rechargeable batteries and a rubber case. The discussion delved into color choices, with silver and black as mainstays, but also considering vibrant options like red and yellow.

A: Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . A: Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . A: You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that . D: Yes . B: Yes . A: Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . A: We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . A: This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . A: You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . A: You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . A: We also have the white-board . A: Uh , we're gonna skip through th No , no . B: Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? A: Just on the on the screen over there . B: No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but Okay . A: Oh , no . A: Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . A: Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important . A: This an explanation of the smart-boards . A: There is a tool-bar over here . A: It's quite simple . A: You have the the pen function , eraser function . A: It's like a very simple uh paint application . A: Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . A: It works like this . A: Oh . A: If pen is selected , yes . A: Oh , no no . B: With that pen ? A: It's not But it is pen . A: It's not working like a pen yet . B: Mm . A: Huh . A: Huh . B: Mm . A: It's doing some stuff now . B: Little bit slower . A: So you can use a pen . A: You can use an eraser . A: And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . A: And then select current colour or line width . A: So , it's quite easy . A: Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . A: Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . A: Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . A: Uh , I'll start off then . A: I'll use this uh same sheet . A: Alright . A: Oh , let me think . A: Different colours . A: Oh . A: Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . A: Uh , a fish . B: piranha . B: Okay . A: Uh . A: Mm-hmm . B: Oh . A: I'm gonna use some different colour now . A: Some a little white . A: Looks like a fish . A: Think it is . A: Oh . A: Oh . A: Uh , colour . A: This is black ? A: I think so . B: Yellow Hmm . A: Oh . A: Oh , this is just uh useless uh drawings but Oh teeth . A: I need teeth . A: Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . A: Okay . A: What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well , I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth . B: Different . A: Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . A: And I like its overall uh aggressive look and Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . B: Okay . A: I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . A: Well , who wants to be next ? D: Nobody , I guess . B: I will try . A: You go , Guido ? B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: I will try . B: Uh Blank ? A: Uh , make a new sheet . A: Uh , it's by pressing on blank . A: Yep . B: Okay . B: Then pen again ? A: Yep . B: Okay . A: And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . B: Okay , um control . D: Format . B: Uh Ah , purple . B: Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . B: Uh I will That's my bird . D: You know , I thought of that actually . B: Yeah ? D: Yeah . B: Isn't it quite it's a little bit light . B: Uh , another colour maybe . B: A red one . B: A small one . B: Uh , line width . B: Two ? B: Three . B: Oh that's okay . B: That's another one . A: Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . B: Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . D: Its simplicity . B: Um , I don't know . B: Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . A: Oh , okay . A: Okay . B: Maybe a little bit . B: Yeah . B: I don't know . A: Okay . A: No , uh it's clear . B: So more uh birds ? A: N no no . A: We get your point . B: Okay , okay , okay . A: Okay . A: Who wants to be next ? D: Yeah , whatever . D: I'll go next . D: Thanks . D: I haven't got a favourite animal too , so Oh . B: M Pictionary . D: What should I draw ? B: A cow . A: Oh . D: Thank you , I'll draw a penguin . B: Okay . D: Yeah . D: I'll draw a penguin . D: Whatever . D: I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already . A: I'll do so . D: Whatever . D: Something like that . D: Come on . B: Yeah , it's little bit hard . D: Mm hmm hmm , orange . B: Orange , of course . D: Whatever . D: Oh , it's better than your bird . B: Uh yeah . D: Everything's better than your bird . B: Yeah . B: True . D: Whatever . D: Hey , it's blue . D: No . D: Whatever . D: Um , I like its ugliness and uh Yeah , whatever . D: The way it walks or whatever . A: Okay . D: Your turn . C: Kay . D: Drawing . C: I'm going to draw a cat . C: I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal . C: And you can have them at home . C: Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and Ye yes , yeah . A: Well , you can have a piranha at home . A: Huh . D: Or a line . B: A little bit . D: I mean a bird . B: Yeah . B: Don't mess with my birds , yeah . C: It's not very uh very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . D: Hmm . D: It's a handicapped cat . B: cat . A: I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . C: It's Ah , it's not scared . C: He's crying but Uh it's i most cats are small . A: Okay . D: He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . A: What do you like about it then ? A: Oh , okay . C: You can handle them . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay , and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . B: Okay . D: I wouldn't call it training , but Alright . A: Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . A: The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . A: And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . A: We're very ambitious on this one . A: The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . A: So that's clear . A: Yeah ? B: Okay . A: Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . A: Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . A: Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? A: Or do they annoy you sometimes ? C: Yes . A: Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? B: Hmm . D: I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . A: Yeah , okay . B: Different . A: Okay . D: And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . D: Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . D: All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . A: Different functions of of uh Okay . D: I think we should group them . A: Yeah . D: And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . A: Okay . A: And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? B: Yeah . A: Uh Mm-hmm . A: Mm-hmm . A: But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . D: Yeah . A: It's what , from my experience . B: But isn't it It's only for television , I thought . D: I don't know . D: Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . A: Okay . A: But we gonna Oh , it is only for televis So wha what What wha what uh what document But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ? D: Yes . B: Not I thought it was only for television . B: So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . D: Yes , it is only for television , but uh Well well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . D: If we think it's useful , we do it . B: Uh , in the email . A: Oh , okay . D: That's right . B: I thought it said uh Yeah , television remote control . D: It's a television remote control . D: But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ Yep . C: Yes , Yes , that's uh something extras . A: Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . A: So we can No , we have to think about that . B: True . B: Yeah . B: True . A: Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or Okay . D: Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . C: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah . D: I guess . C: Only the experts . B: True . A: Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . D: Yeah . A: That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . B: Oh my God . D: Yeah . B: Okay . A: Okay . A: Well , other ideas ? A: How can we make it trendy or something ? A: Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? C: Uh , to go with to go with fashion and Team Leader . A: Maybe a can opener underneath it ? A: I don't know . B: For the bear . A: Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . B: Uh I I uh , no I think it Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . D: Yeah , way too high . D: Yep . B: It's international , so we have to use a standard . A: Okay . A: Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably . D: Well that's an idea of course , yeah . A: Uh , original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . D: Mm-hmm . B: Hmm . A: No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . D: Yeah . A: When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that . A: Kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . A: Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . B: Use friendly . B: Yep . A: Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . A: Well , you know , y like some special feature . A: Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . D: Yeah . D: Yes , what the market wishes . A: Okay . A: Well , the closing . A: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . A: Individual , I think so . A: The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh Already s said that . A: The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah . B: Interface d Oh , I don't I didn't get a message . A: And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . A: User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . A: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . A: I don't know how much time we have left . A: Oh , not many I guess . A: We started at twelve . D: You just got a message . A: Oh , and what does it said ? D: And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half . A: W Okay , well um No , we're uh ahead of schedule then . D: No . D: He's the whatever . B: Oh , the Project Manager . D: Team Leader . D: He is the whatever . A: Yeah , close it . A: I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . B: Okay . A: And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . D: Yes . B: Okay . A: You can all Or we're all uh Yeah . D: Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . A: Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? D: Yeah . D: Yes . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , okay . A: I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready . D: Alright . D: Okay . A: Or we can leave already I guess . A: or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh Okay . D: Yeah . C: No . D: No . D: I don't think so . B: I don't think Oh I will need it . D: Yes ? A: Yes . D: Great . C: Oh . A: We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . D: Yeah . D: Good luck . A: Yeah , good luck . D: I will need it .","summary":"The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops.

D: Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . D: I got like this big black border uh on every side . A: Okay . B: Mm , okay . A: Everybody ready ? D: I'll I'll fix it . B: Yeah , it's okay . D: Yeah , whatever . A: Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . A: Uh this is the agenda , the opening . A: Uh , we've got three presentations . A: And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . A: And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . A: We have uh forty minutes . D: Yes . A: Oh , well this is the the closing already . A: So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then . A: Uh , I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . B: Okay . A: Maybe the Well , it Oh that . D: I don't know what the right order is . D: So Mm-hmm . B: No . C: Huh . A: It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . C: Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ? A: Yeah ? A: Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . B: In project . C: Okay , I've done that . A: You've already done that ? B: No can that open . C: Yes . A: Well let's close this one . A: We'll just uh open a new one . B: Open it there . A: Uh , well . A: Yes . A: Uh-oh . A: New thing . A: Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . A: Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . A: But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . B: Okay . B: About the get Okay . A: And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . C: Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . C: Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . C: It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . C: Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . C: Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . C: Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . C: And and the components are very uh very cheap . C: Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . C: Uh , again , it's a fair price . C: It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . C: Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper . C: It's uh it's all very uh Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . A: Okay . C: Uh , and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . A: Okay . C: I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . C: They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . C: So I don't know uh why I should put it here . C: Uh Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . A: Okay . A: But it's the technical side of the remote control . A: Oh . A: Okay . C: But What ? A: Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . A: But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? C: No . A: It's gonna be easy ? C: Yes . A: Okay . B: But nothing restricted for user interface ? A: Yeah . B: With technical I don't know . C: Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . A: M Okay . B: Kay . C: Remote control is nothing special nowadays . A: R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . B: Okay . A: Doesn't really matter . C: Um I don't think so , because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? B: But I kind of uh Yes . A: Okay . A: Yeah , okay . B: Uh Well , the technical functions . A: Okay . A: Well , we'll see . A: We'll see later on . B: Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . A: No . C: No . B: th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . A: Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? A: The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . A: Yeah . A: Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . B: Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . A: Uh-huh . A: Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . A: we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? D: Yes , I agree . D: Yeah . A: Well , what that's what you want trying to say . B: Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . A: Okay . A: Okay . B: But I don't know . B: It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . A: Yeah , well some of these Uh , yeah . A: Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . B: Yeah , probably , yeah . D: Yes . A: So Mm-hmm . B: Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . B: Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . B: I think that's just basic what we need . B: And from that on we can user requirements what we need more . B: Uh Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . D: Yes . B: M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . D: I haven't really found a conclusion like that . D: Yeah . B: I don't know . B: Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . D: Design . B: I think . D: Sounds interesting . B: Yeah ? B: Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think . A: Okay . B: Yeah , that was it . D: Alright . A: Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . D: Yes . D: Yeah . D: It's alright . D: Um Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . D: Um yes . D: The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . D: Uh , I've lined them up here . D: Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . D: I uh have found some interesting things . D: We do we do got a market . D: Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . D: So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . D: Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . D: Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . D: That's quite a lot . D: Um , relevant options are , of course , power buttons . D: Although , only used once per hour . D: Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . D: Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . D: That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . D: But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . D: Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . D: And um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . D: And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . D: So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . D: We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . D: Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . D: Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . A: Okay . D: And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh Yeah . D: Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say Yes , won't be very present , thank you . A: Visually presents . D: And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . D: That was kind of what I found . A: Okay . B: Okay . D: Okay . A: Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . D: Yes . A: Uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think . A: Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . A: Well , now I see four . D: Two ? A: That's kinda strange . A: Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . A: Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . B: Well No way . D: No uh , I agree , I agree . A: It's impossible , I think . A: So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . D: Not too much , no . D: Yeah . A: So we have to think of that . A: The remote control should only be used for television . A: Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . A: So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . B: Yeah . D: Okay . A: I don't know . A: I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . A: Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . A: New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . A: So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . D: Mm-hmm . A: But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . D: I don't really agree actually , to be honest . D: It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . D: It's only like thirty percent of the total market . D: Mayb yeah ? A: Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . A: That's the one we haven't covered yet . A: So I think that's what the problem is . A: We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think , yeah . D: Okay . D: Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . A: Yeah , I think so . A: Maybe if it's no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . D: Not too much then , bu alright . A: So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . D: Yes . A: Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . A: Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . A: Okay , something else nice to know . B: But what's our slogan ? A: Sorry ? A: Yeah , you will have to look that up . B: The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics . D: Yeah , I'll have a look . D: We put the fashion in electronics . A: I think it's something about the Oh , okay . A: I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but Okay well , let's go back to the the agenda . D: Sense and simplicity . B: Sense simplicity . A: So we've now had to the three presentations . A: We know about the new project requirements . A: That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . A: Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . A: I think we're we're looking for some Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . A: Y well , that Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . A: Yeah . D: I think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes . B: Yeah , but wha But Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . A: Yeah , yeah . A: M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . D: Yeah . B: So why should j we put this function in ? D: Well , I think Yes . B: I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . A: You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . A: We don't want that . A: I think that was that became clear . A: We don't want . A: But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh control , remotely . D: Yeah , control . B: Yeah , but uh you said Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . A: No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah . B: It's n Yeah . B: Yeah . A: I think we maybe should Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . A: But just the basic functions . A: Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ? C: But you can put them under the same button . D: Not much more than that . D: Yep . A: Yeah , if as far as possible . D: Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . D: So t Yeah . A: But what do you think ? A: Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? B: No . A: No , you don't think so ? B: No , new requirements say no . A: Yeah , the new requirements say so . B: So Yeah , but I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions . C: But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . A: Well , maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . A: You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with Yep , exactly . C: Yes , but we Huh . D: Y yes . A: That's that's wha No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . D: But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . D: I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . B: No , no . B: Exactly . A: No , no . A: Okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . D: Yeah , I know , but uh Yes . A: Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . B: Mm , yeah . A: It's c sometimes a bit difficult . A: Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . B: Yeah , but just keep it simple and look more at th No . A: And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . A: If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . B: It's only for television . A: Okay . B: So Yeah . C: Yes , but there are there are But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? A: It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , nothing more . A: Okay . B: Exactly . D: Alright . A: Um , but what televis Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . C: There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have Yes , but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . B: Yeah . A: And simple . B: The user interface is easy . A: Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . A: So we should put uh zap buttons on it . A: Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . B: And the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah . D: Yes , definitely , yeah . A: Uh , Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . B: It's too much integrated in the other . A: But just one big teletext button , on and off . B: Yeah . A: Probably . D: Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . D: I think stop function is very useful . D: If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but Well , I use it very regularly , the action . A: Oh , okay . A: Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . D: I re I use it quite often . A: Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . B: Will you look Look at the market . A: And we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . A: We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . A: Yeah . A: I don't know . A: I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . B: Well Yeah , I uh , it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th Yeah , but True . A: I don't know what you th guys think . D: Might be . D: Might be . A: Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? A: Or do you think it uh I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . A: Yeah . A: Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . A: That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . C: If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . A: Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . C: Yes . A: Then we meet uh the new requirements . A: we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess . B: A simple yeah . A: Okay . A: Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? A: Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . A: We have the zap and uh the volume . A: Should we do m make them very big ? A: The the the zap button . A: D d Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . D: I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep . C: Yes . B: But trendy , yeah . B: I don't know . A: Or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ? C: Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . A: Yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . B: Original . A: You have to use it very quickly . B: It was uh True . D: Yep . D: If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . A: Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . D: Yes . A: Oh , what should we decide on then ? A: I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . C: But No , it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest . B: Yeah . A: Yep . B: Maybe uh Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . A: No , okay , but we don't have to uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . C: No . B: If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . C: The most standard batteries . A: I think I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well , it has to be simple , and I wi Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . D: I think double A_ . B: Yeah ? D: Yep . B: Yeah . D: The most ordinary uh batteries . B: Okay . D: Yep . A: Oh . A: How much time do we ha we have left uh ? A: M m m more than thirty minutes ? D: I think about twenty minutes . A: Uh ten twenty minutes . C: But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . A: Well , uh these these shouldn't Yeah . B: Early break . A: Yeah , okay . A: But that's that's Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? A: How we can what the extra touch can be . C: Maybe th m For the remote control . A: Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them . A: Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . D: I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever . B: To find him . A: Yeah . B: That's maybe yeah . A: I don't know . A: I don't know . A: Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . A: It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . D: Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep . B: Yeah . A: Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . A: Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . A: I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . B: Yeah . A: It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . D: Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . A: Yeah , but the well , it's already been done . B: Yeah , but that's yeah . A: Nah . A: Yeah , that's true . A: But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . D: Yes . A: it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . B: Yeah . D: Yep . A: We're really gonna use them . A: Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . D: No , that's true . A: So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . A: So there's a very important task for you . A: And maybe we can all think about it . B: Be original , yeah . A: Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . B: Mm-hmm . B: And use friendly , yeah . A: So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Must brain-storm . A: Uh-huh . D: Yeah , a swapable front or whatever . A: Yeah , or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . B: Well Why not ? A: It could be be Yeah , you never know , but But it and I think we have to make it quite big . D: Yeah . B: More money for us . B: Yeah . B: Quite big . D: Yes , definitely , definitely . B: Yeah , you think ? A: Yeah , people So , and and also because uh it is expensive . C: That's to be uh a formed for your hand . A: If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it Mm-hmm . D: Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . D: As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o Yeah . A: And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . A: I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah , that it it it it stands up . B: A standard or something . A: Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . D: A face ? D: Or uh yeah , yeah . A: no no , put stuff inside it . D: Yeah . C: More like a joystick then . A: But , it's like like a statue or something Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That it's it's fashionable . D: Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep . B: It's like you have uh four phones . B: Something like that . D: If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . A: I I don't Oh , yeah . D: I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . D: That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? C: But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second Or you can Yeah . D: Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . A: Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it Oh , okay . D: No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . B: On the television . B: Oh , like this . A: Uh , that's kind of nice . D: If an a button in in that uh Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . A: And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . B: A char chargeable . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . D: Why not . B: Why not . A: Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . C: With recharger . D: It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . D: Aye ? A: Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen Uh I I think it's a great idea . B: Production . D: Yeah , okay . B: It should be possible . B: I think it's a good idea . D: Yeah . A: S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . B: To make a base or something ? D: Yes . D: Yes , definitely . D: Yeah . C: Yes , but is that handy ? A: Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . B: It's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy , it's Mm . A: That's one . A: And uh you can always find your remote control up Uh , okay . C: But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . A: Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . C: And then you Yes . A: Does it makes it kinda Yeah , yeah . D: Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . C: Or But you pay for it . D: I don't know . A: Okay . B: Yeah , but that's not it's ugly , I think . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . B: No . D: On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . D: I mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , but um I think the bay is definitely uh Sure , why not . A: Yeah . A: I think it's a good idea . A: And make it , you know , we we um Well , we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . A: We can save on the on the functions . A: We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice . D: Yep . A: And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: We have to something special . D: Yeah . A: And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put Yeah . B: True . B: Yeah . D: Definitely . D: With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . D: Yeah , definitely . A: And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . A: Yeah . A: I think I think it's a good idea . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . A: Yeah . D: Definitely , yeah . A: Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . B: Yeah . A: And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . A: And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . A: If that's too expensive , we won't do that . B: Yeah , we c Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . A: But it would be nice . D: It would be nice , yes . A: It's the idea . A: I know that batteries last long nowadays . A: And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . A: And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that that Yeah , okay . D: Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . A: So , easy functions . A: Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi Yeah . D: Yeah , why not . A: But it's also annoying . A: cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . D: Hmm . B: Yeah . B: true . A: Then it beeps all the time and . D: No , that's true . A: You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . A: And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . A: Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . D: Why not . A: And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . A: Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . B: Yeah . D: Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . A: Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: No . B: And you can leave it just there . D: Nearly . A: M maybe we should really do this . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? A: These clocks aren't uh synched . B: Yes . A: Oh , now I've put uh well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? B: Yeah , I'll Uh fifteen minutes . D: Something like that , yeah . A: Yeah , but we're uh we're done . A: I think . A: We've decided on the functions . A: Well , there is some oh . A: There is a closing sheet . A: We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . D: Oh . A: Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . A: I think these are more important than the first ones , so . D: We'll see . B: Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? B: That not not everything in one one uh folder . D: Maarten , five minutes . A: Oh , five minutes . A: Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . A: Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . B: Yeah . B: Maybe . D: No , that's true uh , yeah . A: And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . A: Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . D: Should we by the way draw um on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of yeah . A: this kind of looks you like . A: Of the shape . B: Or the sh Do you get an idea of the shape ? A: Yeah , probably , it would be nice . D: I dunno . D: Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? D: I don't , for one . C: Maybe like this pen . D: A bit bigger I guess , but The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that . A: No , bigger . B: A little bit bigger , yeah but Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures . C: It has to feel nice in your hand . A: Well , I I I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . D: Yeah . A: We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . D: Okay , yeah . A: That would also be nice . A: But that's gonna then you c then you don't Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . D: Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ? D: Uh Yeah . A: Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . D: Yeah , that's true . A: Would be a nice idea though . A: I don't know . A: I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something . A: Like something like that or so or so And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . D: Something like that is very ergonomic . D: So Yeah . A: It's also round . A: Put it in there uh wire on it . A: Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . B: Yeah , flash lights at the side . A: Volume and programme , yeah . B: At the side , or something like that . D: Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . A: And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess . A: Numbers . B: Yeah . A: And and lights ? A: How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it . D: Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry . B: Yeah , side of it . A: Along the side uh strip of yeah . B: Just two LEDs or something on the side . D: Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . D: Oh . D: Okay . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Well , theys have to be Yeah . B: Well , uh probably at the side . B: You know look at the front , but Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah . A: Yeah , yeah . A: Exactly . A: When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that . A: And then you have a strip of uh lights or something . B: Yeah , something like that , yeah . D: Okay , yeah . A: Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . A: maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . B: No . A: I don't know . B: No . A: Or some bump . D: I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . A: Maybe some Yeah ? B: Bumper or something . A: We'll have to think about it . A: I think we're we're done . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yes , we are . A: We can save this one . B: Lunch break . D: Alright . D: Yes , I guess it's lunch time . B: Okay then . A: Mm mm . D: I don't know . D: Half and hour ? D: I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . B: Okay , five uh Oh . A: Yeah , that was what uh Mm , we'll hear about it . D: I don't know about the lunch break .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting. The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on\/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD\/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base\/recharger with locator function. The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. The project manager will write up the minutes, and put the minutes from both this meeting and the previous one in the project folder. The marketing expert, industrial designer and user interface designer will have thirty minutes after lunch to work on their individual presentations. The remote will have a simple, trendy design, with some kind of special feature that makes it stand out. If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger. Even though the new project requirements stated that teletext was outdated, the group felt they should still include one teletext button. The group were still unsure whether to include some DVD\/VCR functions on the remote. The group had difficulty deciding what special feature they should include to make their product stand out. The group were not sure whether to include a base\/recharger for the remote. They were not sure how much a recharger would cost to make.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design meeting, Maarten led the discussion with participants including B, C, and D, who shared technical issues with their devices. The agenda covered three presentations, focusing on new project requirements and deciding on remote control functions within a 40-minute timeframe. C delved into the technical aspects of remote controls, emphasizing cost-effectiveness and common technology components. The team debated the need for complex functions versus simplicity, considering user preferences and market trends. They agreed to prioritize basic TV functions, like channel selection and volume control, while potentially excluding DVD and VCR features to maintain simplicity. Action items included designing a trendy, user-friendly remote control with big buttons and a unique shape, possibly incorporating rechargeable batteries within a \u20ac25 budget. They discussed adding lights for visual appeal and practicality, aiming for a design that stands out on a coffee table. The meeting concluded with plans for individual work sessions and a lunch break, leaving room for further brainstorming on the remote control's final design.","relevance":0.484172821,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"Who led the functional design meeting?","answer":"Maarten"},{"question":"What were some of the basic TV functions agreed upon for the remote control?","answer":"Channel selection, volume control"},{"question":"What was the proposed unique feature for the remote control design?","answer":"Possibly incorporating rechargeable batteries"},{"question":"How did the team plan to make the remote control stand out on a coffee table?","answer":"By designing it with big buttons, unique shape, and possibly incorporating lights"}]}
{"meeting_id":"TS3008c","dialogue":"A: Okay , all set ? A: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . B: Uh , okay . C: Yes . A: The agenda . A: The opening . A: I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . A: So um , who wants to start off ? A: Technical uh designer again ? B: Again . A: Okay . B: Hmm . A: Uh , yeah . A: Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . A: It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . B: Mm-hmm . D: Okay . A: So But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard . B: Uh , may be better , yeah . D: Keyboard work . A: I think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Alright . C: Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . C: Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . C: We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls . C: Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . C: Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . C: Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . C: Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . C: Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . C: Mm It's okay . C: Yeah . C: I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . C: Uh Um the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . B: Oh . C: Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy . C: Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . C: Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . C: Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . B: Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . D: That's true , I guess . D: Yeah . B: Well , maybe a little bit expensive . B: I don't know . D: Huh . C: Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . C: Um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . C: Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . C: Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . C: Mm , I've told about uh the three first points . C: Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . C: Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . C: Um , another possibility . C: I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . C: Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . A: Twelve and a half . C: Ah yeah . A: Actually What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so But it's actually kind of uh well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , production cost . C: I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . C: You see uh a covers , which can be Um , I don't know . C: Um Yes . B: I Different colours also . D: Yep . C: Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . A: And we can we can steal their ideas . C: Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh uh house uh stuff . A: Huh . A: Well , it's a possibility , too . C: Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but Yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . A: Uh-uh . D: Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess . A: Okay . A: Next time we're here . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Oh , okay . D: Yeah . D: Definitely . A: Okay . C: Thank you . D: Alright . B: Okay . B: uh Ah . D: Yeah . D: That's okay . B: Well , I shall go to the next slide . B: Um um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . B: I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . A: Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . A: Didn't we ? A: Oh , okay . B: I ha I ha I have the I have nothing . A: Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . B: Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . A: Okay . B: I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more , but Yeah . A: Well we maybe we can think of that later . A: W just these are the ones you already summed up in the Okay . B: Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . B: Um Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . B: Um , I don't know what costs of it . B: Uh , I've no idea about it . B: Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . B: I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . B: Production . A: Yeah . C: Uh-huh . B: If we got already uh something like a base . A: That might get redundant also maybe . A: I don't know what kind of information it would Yeah . B: Yeah , I don't know . B: I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . D: Mm yeah . B: Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . A: Yeah , it's okay . C: Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control . B: But The remote control . B: a little uh too A little bit A little bit too big , I think . D: Then you and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . A: Okay . A: That's not It was not a good idea . D: Yeah . B: Exactly . A: Okay . B: Um , yeah . B: Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . A: No . B: It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of uh , so that's very easy . A: No . D: No . B: Um Mm-hmm . A: But you do mention the next and previous uh button . D: Next channel , previous channel . B: Well , that's next channel . A: Oh , okay , o okay okay . B: I mean next channel . B: Uh Um oh , I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . A: Huh . B: So , it's uh just an idea . B: And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . C: But you're the expert . D: I think it depends on the function . A: Mm-hmm . B: Maybe it Well uh okay , that's your point . D: Well , if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . B: Um , yeah . B: Yeah , okay . B: Yeah , I've nothing to s Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . A: Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . D: Oh , that's right . D: Yeah . B: I thought so , but maybe with the Yeah , that groups . A: Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . A: Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh I think yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , because that's the mo it it you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? B: Large ? B: Yeah . D: Yep . B: Most the most used uh buttons . D: Those are probably the the th Yes . A: It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t Yeah . B: True . B: Yeah . D: Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . C: You did the research . A: And you want to acc accentuate that , you know . B: Yeah . D: Sorry ? C: It's from your research . D: Yeah , sure . B: Okay . A: So Okay . B: Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . B: I didn't had any time left . B: So Yeah , . A: No uh , that's coo it's cool . D: You don't care . D: No , sorry . D: Yeah . D: Oh . D: Go away . D: Come on . B: It's there . B: Yeah , click on it . B: Couple time . D: Oh , great . D: Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . D: Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . D: Some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . D: Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . D: The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . D: Uh , our market really likes really likes that . D: And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . D: And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . D: Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . D: So we probably won't do that . D: The younger market likes uh Well , the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . D: I found this image , which is uh Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . D: I don't see the spongy part in it . D: But with a little bit of fancy Exactly . A: Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . D: I got some ideas Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . D: Uh , catchy colours . D: Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . D: So , remote controls in in catchy colours . A: It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . D: Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . A: Not the dark colours ? A: Okay . D: No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . A: Okay . D: And uh , the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . D: But to Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . D: At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . D: And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say ? A: For diversity or something . D: Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . A: Uh No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . B: Well , how uh But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? D: I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . D: Yes . D: Yeah , there's there's always a Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . B: Uh , make it a banana ? A: It's like a pear or something . D: I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . A: No , I don't think you have to do it like Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . D: So you you can put some fruity things No , of course not . A: And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . D: Especially i Yeah , yeah . B: Yeah , but th yeah , but that Yeah , but that's Yeah uh uh But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? D: Yeah , exactly . D: If we make it little bit greenish . A: Yeah . A: You do get the idea , eh ? A: The fruity kind of round 'Kay . D: A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ? A: Yeah , uh yeah , I don't know . C: Grapes . D: Uh Isn't Wha whatever . A: Uh , this is a b yeah . A: Yeah , yeah . A: Of course we have uh we have a very big uh the s Of d design team , yeah . D: Yeah , sure . D: Yeah . D: Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . C: For a big team of artists . D: This is then the uh pear . D: I don't know the English word , so forget it . A: Yeah , but It's pear , I guess . D: And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . C: But uh but I think we don't have to make we can't make all uh ten designs . A: No . C: We have to make one design I th I I think . A: No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . D: Mayb maybe two or three . B: Yeah . A: Uh , it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . D: Yeah . D: No sure , but but B but that's great , and and and what I was what what I was saying , the catchy colours Yeah . A: And it's it looks fruity to me . A: And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too . C: But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . A: Maybe it's too much , you know . B: But , we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . D: Yeah , uh not really . D: Pictures was a was a bad word , but Well we c yeah . A: Okay , but what are the This is yellow . B: Yellow , a Real Reaction . D: Yeah , sure . A: But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . B: Uh , yeah . D: Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . C: Yes , it's really fruity . B: We uh f A yellow do Uh , yeah . D: I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . D: If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . D: It doesn't work . D: And then Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know . B: Yeah , and the button then . C: With a strawberry on top . A: Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do Okay . B: Okay , yeah . D: On the front , of course , because else you can't find it . B: Okay . D: Well , that were my ideas a little bit . D: I'll close 'em down . D: Um , go away . A: Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ? D: Conceptual design , yes . A: See what was on the agenda . B: Lazy . D: The agenda . A: This is his own remote . A: Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , but I don't think it's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? B: Yeah . D: Well , it's nice , of course . C: Only if we Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . D: But I don't I don't know what to display on it . D: I mean Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because Yeah , I don't know . A: Me neither . A: Yeah , but it's so I don't think we should do it . C: No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . C: You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . C: Yes , it can On your No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . C: So why not on your remote ? A: Yeah , but no . A: I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . A: And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , it's But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . B: Well well what would you display on it then ? C: Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide on t on teletext , yes . D: Programme information . B: But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? D: But Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , but whatever . C: Also on the internet . C: But Yes , but you also want to know what's next . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , and we also have to yeah . D: Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . C: Yes , that's uh really possible . D: Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . B: And I also Yeah , I dunno . A: I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . A: It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . D: Yeah . A: But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . A: You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . D: That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile . A: Yeah , yeah . A: You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after . D: No . D: No . D: I don't think so ei either . A: But that's my opinion . A: Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . A: You want the L_C_D_ display . C: No . A: I don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him . A: If we wanna And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . D: Ah . B: Oh , okay . D: Bastard . A: So I can also say But did we skip the Yeah , you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . B: We can you away . B: Yeah , I don't know . B: Uh , uh I i if it's it's a simple p No , that that's right , and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . C: No uh um Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . A: So Nah , that's not gonna work . B: Kind of L_C_D_ or something or But how does it display then ? D: Yeah , I guess . B: W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? C: Uh , then you push a button . C: The title and the information about the programme . B: About that programme ? C: But but uh yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first you have the biggest uh Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . D: No . A: Yeah . A: Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . A: Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . B: Yeah . A: So it's that that's what I've seen . D: Yeah , that's true , if you uh Yeah . A: But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept . C: But uh I haven't thought about it . C: But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . A: Well yeah , yeah , okay . C: You can throw with it and When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . A: That's maybe not the most important , but it's just I don't think so . B: Is it fashion ? B: I don't know . B: That's not up to you . B: That's up to market if i if it's trendy . A: Yeah , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? D: No . B: Because our our motto is we put fashion Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . D: Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . D: And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . D: But I don't think Uh , I think it will be too expensive . C: And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . A: Yeah yeah yeah . C: So why don't we use it . D: Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? A: Yeah , but we're gonna if it Then uh then you better don't yeah , d Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . B: Coloured If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and With one thing special . D: Yeah really , if y if you c i I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . D: Really . C: No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . C: But I didn't think that Yes , but o on the No , when y But it look Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . A: I'm sorry . A: It can't co you cannot convince me . A: I don't know how well how to with you guys , but I don't really feel it . A: We already we're uh Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft I don't think I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . D: Yeah . D: W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . D: And I think We have a pear . B: Not a whole package of specialty . A: Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . A: Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . A: It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . C: The simple Yes , but but when you want to have something special Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . A: Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is It has to be developed , but no , but it that's that's our that's our killer feature . B: And uh the Yeah . B: It's just an it's just an idea . A: That's our what makes it special . B: It's a it's True . C: Yes , it was already made . C: Tha the remote control on the docking station . A: Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . D: Is that so ? D: Was it it wasn't just a prototype ? C: Yes , he have a picture of it . B: Well uh I uh Yeah , I dunno . D: Exactly , I've never seen it in a store . A: Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . A: I don't uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? A: I d Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . B: No , it's too much . D: I think it's a little too much , yeah . B: It's overdone . C: Okay . D: Okay . A: I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . B: Democratically . D: No . C: Mayb I will rule the world with it . A: But Probably so . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . A: Okay . A: But for the technical part . A: The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . C: Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is Yes . A: Uh Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . A: This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . D: Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . B: With a spongy Bob feel . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Like a b yes . A: You can st throw it at your little brother's head . B: Yeah , you just can drop it . D: Yeah , airbag . B: Yeah . D: If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: No no no , not that comfy . C: Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . A: Yeah yeah . A: Yeah . A: Okay , that's a that's a good point . A: And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . D: Yeah . B: But not black I think . D: No . B: Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . A: Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . D: Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at . B: But can we ge uh uh Can we combine it or something ? A: It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just Yeah . B: Uh with uh yellow and black ? A: Yeah , maybe so . B: Make it a bee ? D: What ? B: A bee . D: Oh , a bee . D: Oh . A: No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination . A: But it is our company colours . C: Yes , real real good colours . A: Apparently . B: Yeah , it's our yeah . B: We we have to use yellow . D: Yeah . D: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: I don't like yellow , and uh maybe I don't know . D: Well , we can as as I draw really nicely over there . C: But that's not really fruity . D: We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . D: Uh , yeah . D: And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . A: But Okay , but what uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? D: But , i Yeah . C: Uh fronts of the We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the telephone . A: Should we do that ? A: I don't think you we should do that . A: Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . B: Different fronts . D: I guess that's that's enough . A: People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , I guess . D: That's way too Nokia . B: Yeah . B: Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . C: Are these designs ? A: Yeah , yeah . D: Yeah , definitely . B: Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . D: Just bring more designs on the market . A: But uh , without gon uh okay . D: Why not , yeah . A: So , are we through the technical part then ? C: Yes . A: Okay . A: So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but Yeah . C: It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . B: Well , yeah , the Three to one . B: That's And tita uh titanium , is uh is is it a no ? A: The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . C: Yes . A: O o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . C: Yes , But also w Yes , b bu but when we use s soft mm Mm . B: Is It's just like that , th this titanium . A: But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? D: Sure . A: Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . B: No , not all , not all of them . C: But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . C: It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . A: It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well . C: No uh , titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's true . A: No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah . C: But also on the colours , the young Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the Yes . A: Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . A: Well would it be more trendy ? A: More chic ? D: Yeah , I think it I think it does . B: Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . B: In trendy things . D: Yeah , o On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh Yeah , that's true , that's true . B: Yeah . B: It's cold in the winter . A: Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . B: Yeah . A: But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . C: Sports and gaming . C: Define . A: And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . A: It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . D: Yes . B: You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . D: Yeah . B: Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? C: Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic . B: Isn't it Is plastic ? B: Well , it's titanium looking . C: Yes , w we can do that on the on the We can make this as a style too . D: What ? B: Yeah , he is . B: Here he is . B: Uh , the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . B: Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very rough . D: Oh , yeah . D: Okay , yeah . A: Yeah , that's beautiful . D: Yeah , I see . D: Yeah , but but but Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . C: Uh , this is uh just a No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . A: Oh , maybe th maybe this is an No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . D: Uh Yeah . C: Uh I don't have the information . A: You know , like the the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible . C: Uh , I I didn't got it Yes . A: But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . B: True . A: But make it just like shiny . D: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah yeah , true . A: Maybe we should uh shou And uh and maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh , how how much time have we got left ? C: Like the M_P_ three player . B: Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . B: But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe I don't know . D: Yeah . C: Uh , in a lot of other uh in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . B: What time does The rubber . A: Forty minutes . C: Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and Yes , and and styles . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: You putting in different colours . A: Okay . C: They have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it , a and uh Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes . D: Uh yeah , yeah . A: Okay . A: Yeah , but w yeah . A: Well , it is . A: It's a possibility . A: But , let's think about the bas Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . D: Yes . D: New prints on it . D: Yep . A: But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . A: And and pro and lights . A: We have to incorporate the lights too . A: But , uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? A: Is that the idea ? A: Is that a good idea ? D: How do you mean ? D: Th th the uh base in a in another Yes . A: How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . A: How many colours are we gonna give it ? A: Like two-tone colour ? C: There there are three uh components three components type . A: T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour . B: Yeah . B: Uh no , not too much I think . C: You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th Yes . D: How the buttons yeah . B: Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh In in another colour . D: Yeah . A: Okay , but not more than Well , yeah , it's No . B: Not more than two colours I think . D: No , definitely not . B: It's a g a little bit too flashy . A: Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . D: Yes , definitely . C: Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right Okay . A: Okay . A: But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . A: Uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . B: The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . A: No . D: No , I think that's too vulnerable . B: Yeah . A: I think this is okay , the so we have the basic . A: Then we have the numbers . A: We have the power button . A: We have we have a teletext button . B: The volume , teletext and Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? A: And maybe want to access a a menu or something . D: Yeah , but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . A: Most T_V_s have a menu . A: Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . A: That's just i the only button only You know , I No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . B: Is uh isn't that different from every television ? D: Mm . D: Yeah , if it's c if Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then Yeah . A: And so But that that covers all the all the other settings . A: It covers everything then . D: Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . A: No , you can use the And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . A: Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . D: Mm , yeah . D: A mute and a teletext and a menu . B: Mute . A: A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . D: That's all . A: It's all we need . B: Yeah . D: Hmm . A: Okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . D: Great . D: Yeah . B: Okay , that's not mu not much functions . B: So Okay . A: Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . D: Yeah , definitely . A: Uh , in one colour . D: Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? A: Just use I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . C: Uh What are we going to do now ? D: Yeah , that's true , that's true . A: And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . A: Just round shapes with uh Yeah , but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . D: Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w Yeah , definitely . A: Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that . D: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Okay . A: Guess we're through then . D: I guess so . A: But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . A: I think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um But our des design experts will uh work that out . D: Yes . B: Yeah . B: Too much colour , i it uh when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe . D: Yea yeah . B: It has to be Yeah . A: Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . D: Yep . A: So we will wrap up . D: Something like that . A: Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? D: I guess not . A: That's right . A: Okay . D: Do you , guys ? B: No . D: No ? A: Okay . A: Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably . D: In the shared folder . B: Oh , okay , yeah . A: Yeah uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . A: Uh , y yeah . D: You'll see in you email , I guess . B: Yeah . A: I think uh But toilet paper roll and uh Okay . D: Yeah , I don't know . D: I don't know . B: I hope so . B: And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . B: You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh Yeah . C: I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . D: Construct one , yeah . B: With you laptop ? B: Yeah . B: Oh my God . D: Alright , shall we get back to work ? A: Yep . D: Great . A: I was waiting for the l last message , but Mm yeah . B: Well you are . D: Yeah . B: We're not . D: Bastard . C: Back to the pen .","summary":"The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. A fancy look and feel is most important to users, followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo. The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it. The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting. The project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder, using a keyboard instead of the digital pen. The rest of the group will receive instructions via email. The remote will not feature an LCD screen. The remote will be available in different colour schemes, but not with changeable fronts. The case will be made of plastic and rubber. The remote will feature power, skip, volume, mute, teletext and menu buttons. The project manager had problems using the digital pen to write the minutes. The group were not sure to what extent the remote should incorporate the fruit and vegetable theme. The industrial designer was keen to incorporate an LCD screen, but the others were not so sure. The group were not sure whether to use plastic and rubber or titanium for the case. They were not sure how to use fruity colours without being too flashy.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the conceptual design meeting, A, the secretary, welcomed participants B, C, and D. The meeting revolved around discussing the design elements for a remote control, focusing on materials, colors, and functionalities. C emphasized the importance of selecting materials wisely to enhance the user experience and potentially increase sales. The team debated using plastic and rubber for a sturdy yet comfortable design, with considerations for trendy elements like titanium and LCD displays. However, they ultimately decided against the LCD display due to cost and design coherence. They agreed on a simple, two-tone color scheme for the remote control and docking station, aiming for a balance between trendy and practical. Action items included creating a prototype and considering the design's subtlety and color balance. The meeting concluded with plans to review the minutes and move forward with the design process, with a touch of humor and camaraderie among the team members. The financial constraints were not explicitly mentioned, but the team's focus on practicality and trendiness hinted at a balance between cost-effectiveness and market appeal.","relevance":0.3615472913,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What materials were discussed for the remote control design?","answer":"The team discussed using plastic and rubber for a sturdy and comfortable design."},{"question":"Why did the team decide against using an LCD display in the remote control?","answer":"The team decided against the LCD display due to cost and design coherence concerns."},{"question":"What color scheme did the team agree on for the remote control and docking station?","answer":"The team agreed on a simple, two-tone color scheme for the remote control and docking station."},{"question":"What were the action items discussed at the end of the meeting?","answer":"The action items included creating a prototype and considering the design's subtlety and color balance."}]}

A: Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? A: You two guys ? C: Yes . A: Okay . A: Go ahead . B: coffee . C: Kay , we've made a prototype . C: Um , we've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting . C: Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . C: Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . C: The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . C: Um , our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . C: Maybe you can uh point them uh The functions . B: Uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . B: Uh , it's a little bit . B: Uh , power button . B: Uh then the the the nine uh channels . B: Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . B: And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext I thought that was th Oh , the mute button . A: Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . D: Alright , I Yeah . A: Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button ? C: But uh that It's uh here then , in the middle . B: Yeah . D: Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . A: Huh . C: Yes , um we've disc Most of the users Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah . B: Well , yeah mo uh mo Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . D: Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the on Yeah , and a and a triangle on that . B: Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . D: Yes . D: Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . A: Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . A: Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d I call it teens and twenties . A: Uh , y th th th the two numbers . C: Yes . D: All n no , that's um kinda dependent on the television . B: Yeah , true , yeah . C: It's a television . C: Yes . A: Yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some uh some have to Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds No , I don't think so . B: Uh Uh I think so . D: I think Yeah , I think you should add A cross , or whatever . C: Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes . B: Zero ? B: May maybe here ? D: Yeah , line . B: Yeah . B: And then a second . D: No , that's dependent on the television . C: Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press Yes , but but a lot uh Yes , but some televisions don't accept uh that that No , no , but s Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . D: I do know so . B: Is it depending on television ? A: Nah , I don't think so really , because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . D: Yeah . D: Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . D: Or actually , the other way around . D: But Yeah . A: No , I think uh I really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . D: Yeah , well but su If No no no . A: Yeah , because that's i it's for television . A: It's exact the same thing . D: So some television respond differently . D: Look , if uh i i Yes . A: No , listen listen . A: When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . A: I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . D: Yes , that's true . A: The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . B: Yeah . B: True . D: No No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . A: I think it works that way , really . A: Yeah , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . A: Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . D: Yep . D: True . A: I think it's exact the same thing when y No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . C: You want Yes , but some television don't support it . B: But the ex Yeah . A: Listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , eh ? A: That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . A: When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . A: Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had Yeah . D: No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No , that's not true . C: No , a remote can Yes , so they need no , they need No , but uh Yeah , it And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . A: But you give the input . A: You push the one . A: That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is . D: It's simply not true . A: Think about it . D: It's simply not true . B: You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something We'll discuss them in the usability lab . D: Uh No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . A: And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . D: Remote control is a stupid thing . D: If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . A: Yeah , that's true . A: Yeah , but I m uh but it's I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . A: But okay , we we'll impl No , we'll apply them then for now . D: No , definitely not . D: Definitely not . B: Uh eva evaluation . B: I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . A: Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . B: Yeah ? A: Yeah , I think so . A: Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether Yeah but okay . B: Okay . D: Yes . B: Ach . D: Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . A: What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: No , no . A: I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . C: Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . A: I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . C: Uh , some N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . A: M Th won't work wi with uh to have that special button . C: When you uh press one button , you give one signal . C: And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . C: But When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . D: Yep . A: Okay , well we'll see . D: Okay . D: I kinda miss the docking station . B: Yeah . C: Yes . C: It's here on the We came uh Yes . B: Well it yeah , uh there's nothing I think it's pretty basic , the the there's no fu there's one there's one button , that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . D: No nothing really trendy about it . C: But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . D: The button . D: Yep . C: So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . D: I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . C: Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh Yes , but we can make No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . D: Yeah , of course . D: Mm-hmm . D: Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course . D: The technology and the voltage can be the same . D: That's uh that's true . D: But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . D: Yeah , that's true , but uh Yes , but uh I I g Shouldn't it fall then ? C: When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . C: Just have to be big enough for the biggest No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . D: It isn't going to fall down ? D: That's a bit uh yeah , I think No , but if if like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , I won't draw it really . C: But then it's a little bit But it's just an idea . D: If you got a base which is uh as big as this Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can Yeah . C: But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . B: You can . B: But i i i it's backwards . C: Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big Yes , little holer littler Uh , little products go deeper in it . B: But it's it's backwards . B: It's leaning . B: It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . D: Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh , right , help . B: That's text . A: But Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . D: Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the Yeah . D: That i that is possible , yep . D: Yeah , sure , you're right . C: Yes . C: And uh uh the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . D: Oh . A: But we have to look n I don't know . D: I don't like the colours . D: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . C: So it's it's it's really good design . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: Yes . D: Alright . A: That's it ? C: Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . D: The light . D: Okay . D: And other lights ? A: I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . C: Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . D: No , o on the on the front . D: Yeah , okay . D: Maybe the uh the logo . C: Yes . B: lights ? C: But , it will also uh uh use batteries , and do we want to The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh Yes . D: Yeah , why not ? D: Of course . A: Okay . B: Mm . A: For now , uh this is uh is good enough . D: Okay . A: Yeah , what was uh on the Okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? A: Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . A: And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . C: Yes . B: Yeah . D: Uh , in the same colour as the side . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , I think I think that'll be good . A: Okay . B: Yeah . A: And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . B: Yeah . C: Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh Yes . D: Yes . A: Cause I also don yeah , it's depends on the costs and such . D: Yep . D: Yeah . A: But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . A: Okay , for now this is this is okay . D: We will . A: Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? A: Uh , I have to see the agenda . D: Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah . C: No . A: Detail design . D: We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost Yep , that's me . A: Evaluation criteria . A: Okay . B: Okay . D: Alright . D: I will be needing that image , so leave it please . D: Um Go away . D: Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . D: Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . D: I wanna have a colour over here , come on . D: Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . D: Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . A: Okay . D: The remote control is not ugly . D: How do you feel ? A: Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . A: Uh , I mean it's kind of , our design . A: It's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . D: Yes . C: Yeah . D: Background colour . A: I don't know or uh I don't know how you Casting . D: How do you guys feel ? C: I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own uh more to your own personality or or house style . A: Yeah . D: The different designs . D: Yes . B: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Yeah , but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . D: No , not not fronts , but different designs . A: With a colour a co a colours . B: No , not fronts . B: Different designs . C: Yes . A: Oh , okay . D: And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . B: Different colours maybe , yeah . A: Okay , but Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our Yeah . D: What ? D: Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? C: Or forty . D: Personally . D: Personally . B: We can make it a one . D: Yes , but what is it ? C: I think two or three . B: Mm yeah . D: Guido ? B: I agree . D: Two or three . B: Um , I uh I go for the positive . D: I was I was thinking about three , so I guess three is uh a bit uh oh , what am I doing ? B: So I go for two . A: Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh Yeah well , let that let's make that a one . B: Okay , three . D: I'll mark it . D: The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . B: Yeah . C: Yes . B: Two . D: Yeah ? B: One . B: One . D: Antek , you agree ? C: Yes . B: Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . C: Yes . D: Yeah . A: That's one thing for sure . D: You're not Antek . B: I'm the I'm the usability , so Yeah . D: I totally agree . D: The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . C: Yes . A: Yeah , two or a one , I guess . B: The Well Yeah , well menu Yeah , maybe . A: It's something we really put work into . D: Yeah , I yeah . D: I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . C: It's all about the buttons . D: And our oh yeah , it's a b yeah . D: Yeah ? D: Alright . D: That's a one ? D: You agree ? A: Yeah . D: The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . D: I think we totally succeeded there . A: But Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . D: Oh Yeah , that's true . A: And telete Yeah , we don't know if the uh they're necessary . D: That's true . C: Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , o they're used uh uh Can yes , three , two . D: the the yeah , m well , you d you've got a point . A: I think a two . B: Yeah , true . B: Yeah , I agree . A: Came a long way , but not we didn't not uh No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is yeah . D: Two or three ? B: Mm two . D: Two ? C: But you can't make a remote control without them , because Yes . D: Antek . B: Because we got Well . D: Nay that that that's true , that's true . D: They're definitely needed . D: So we put it on a two ? D: The remote control has got a really trendy look . C: Yes . C: A one . D: Maarten . A: Yeah , uh a t I think a two . A: Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture . D: Yeah . C: We we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . B: Yeah . D: Ever , yeah . D: Guido . A: But I do think it's more But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . B: Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah . B: I I th Yeah . D: Yeah , uh I agree . C: Yes . D: I agree . A: So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the A th a three . B: True , yeah . D: I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh oh , yeah , that's true . D: You agree on the two ? B: Yeah . C: Yes . A: I i uh when you compare to the Uh uh what's the difference with Okay . D: Great . D: Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . D: Uh , I copied that one . D: Well , uh forget that . D: Um Go away . D: Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . B: No . C: No . A: No . B: We're not well , maybe the the the on the side . C: No , not L_C_D_ , so . A: Yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? D: Yeah , and the light . A: Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . B: And the light maybe . C: But that that's not innovative . B: But Well , six . A: And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , it's more No , six . D: Well , I g It's not seven ? C: Lights lights are Six . A: Or seven maybe , yeah . B: No , six . A: Or six . D: Why uh why not a seven ? B: Six . A: Yeah , mine is seven . C: Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , but it but it With the lights it it's it's kind of future But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with Yes . B: Yeah . D: How ? A: Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . D: Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? D: Well , it's n true . D: Uh , I agree , m but I'll Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . B: Innovative in generally or just f original for A docking station is innova Okay . A: N no no , t . D: Yeah , it it's I think I think with its I think more m Uh that that's n No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we It's it's a six . C: The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . A: Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station , it's gonna be a kind of a problem . C: It's a part of the remote . C: And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker . A: But Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . A: Well I i yeah . C: Okay . A: No ? A: Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev six maybe , because Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah . B: Six . C: But the retrieval or the Yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ? D: That m f Yeah , for the retrieval function . D: Yeah . D: I think that's very innovative for a remote control . A: Yeah , v Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and no no , you know what I mean . C: To put it on your head . A: You have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your yeah . D: Yeah sure , but But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , but Remote control is easy to use . A: Yeah , it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . C: Yes . B: Yeah , a two . C: Yes . D: I think a two . D: Yeah ? A: Yeah , it's good . B: More two . D: Come on . D: The remote control hasn't got uh . A: No , I would have seen that one before . A: Oh , you skipped one uh Uh , here . D: I've just filled uh Go away . C: You like the buttons . D: I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . A: Remote control will be bought by Yeah . D: It will be bought by people under the age of forty . C: Yes . B: Yes . A: Definitely . C: In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? A: Well Uh , just in general . D: No no no . D: No , just if they if they buy it . A: Yeah , a two . C: We don't know . A: Yeah , but I think I think two . C: But Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . D: Yeah , what do you think ? B: Yeah , I think two , yeah . B: I agree . D: Antek ? B: Two . A: Uh , that is not the question . D: No , that's no comparison . A: It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . A: Yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it . D: And I don't mean two people . C: This is just guessing . A: Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two . C: Make it a two . D: W w Right , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . C: When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu A logo . A: Oh no . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious . B: We don't have the slogan though . D: Oh , the slogan . A: Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . D: Can we see the slogan ? B: The logo . A: Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to . B: Underneath it or something . C: Yes , uh encrypted uh with Yes . A: Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . D: Are we gonna do that ? B: A three . A: Maybe a three this time . B: Three . B: Yeah , a three . D: Three ? D: I agree . D: Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . A: And uh Uh , it's a one or a two . B: Yeah , two . C: Yes . D: Two ? A: Yeah , make it a two . B: Two . D: Two . D: Alright . D: We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . D: Four , five , seven , nine . D: Forget that . D: Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . D: Twenty six . D: It's a two point six . A: It's not that bad . D: Alright , we yeah . A: Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , which is uh quite a great score . D: Yeah . D: True . A: Okay . A: Uh , this is was uh the evaluation ? D: This was my evaluation . A: Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has Yeah . D: So We did a pretty nice job until now . D: Um , is this your Whatever . C: Is there something after this uh meeting ? D: Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . C: Or Okay . B: No . B: Okay , yeah . A: Still opened or uh Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Okay , finance . A: Because um I received uh a spreadsheet . B: Shoot . D: A five . D: A five . A: Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . A: Oh . D: Doesn't matter . A: I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a . A: Didn't really finish it . A: Well , we uh We'll see . A: We'll stumble upon some problems . D: We probably will . A: I probably have already opened it here . A: try it again . A: First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . A: But let's let's st start with beginning . A: We include one battery . A: I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here . A: Uh , price is given . A: We um yeah , we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . D: The amount , yeah . A: And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . A: I don't know if it's filled in properly . A: Okay , we need one battery . A: One battery . A: I think one battery is enough . C: Yes . A: We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A: A s okay , this this is a p first problem . A: Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips Okay . C: Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . A: But Where did we find this information ? C: The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh No , uh I Yes , my my my uh The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe . D: I don't know I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . A: Was it I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . B: No . D: Yeah . A: But do you th you do you know what chip we need ? D: Yeah . D: And how do you know ? D: I mean , you got that email . C: Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . D: Did it point out what to use them for ? A: Maybe you can uh look it up right now . A: Okay , but okay . A: When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what then it would be a simple chip . C: Then it's a simple chip . A: And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . C: Yes , I I I s I That will be enough for future uh recommendations . D: Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . A: Okay . A: Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . A: The sample sensor sample speaker . A: What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is . C: I don't know it uh either . D: I don't know . A: Okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . C: Yes . A: And with a special colour . A: I guess that's what we were Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w uh Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . B: Well , special colour . C: Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . D: I don't know if it's very special . B: I don't Mm okay . C: Standard rubber . D: Alright , that's okay . A: Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . C: St Yes . A: Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? B: Whoa , it's a little That's huge . A: Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . B: No . B: We have the simplest buttons . D: No . C: No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . A: Yeah . D: I don't think so , because it says amount . C: If you use a scroll-wheel Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . A: Ah . A: Yeah , it wouldn't Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know . D: The the the yellow row is the amount of To n that's total of four buttons . A: I And I count them like this . C: You can have f four kind of push-buttons . C: Rubber . B: Uh , one til nine . C: You can have uh Different , yes . B: Is that one or is that nine buttons ? A: One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . B: Yeah . A: Because Oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . A: Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . A: Yes . A: And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . D: I think that Eighteen . D: One two three four five , si Fifty cents for one single stupid button . C: Why is that so uh expensive . A: Yeah , I don't understand . A: Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . B: Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? C: So , whe when you so then it It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . B: No way . A: Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . A: Here , now it's now it's already s shall we just give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem . D: Yeah , exactly . D: Yeah . A: It would be impossible to make it And and less buttons than this isn't possible . D: I can't I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . B: It's way No , no no . D: Really . C: Board . D: Yeah , yeah , No , really . C: And then throw it But whe I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , but but Uh , it's it's still for little children . A: This is the most simple yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before . A: Yeah , without the numbers . A: That's possible . B: Yeah , uh That's still four . A: Yeah , we could skip the numbers . D: Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . D: Really . C: They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo Yes , it's for it's li uh it's just for a little Otherwise , it Otherwise it would be the Special form also , it says . D: Yeah . A: Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . B: Yeah , that's no option , that's no option . A: Okay , we'll we'll just okay . A: But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . A: Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . A: We'll give the buttons special colour . A: We'll give them a special form . A: Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . B: A special colour , why a special colour ? A: Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . B: But wha what s what special ? A: I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . B: Okay , yeah . D: I don't think the special form is really true . B: Uh , yeah . A: I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it Yeah , special material r also , because i has rubber . D: Is it ? A: And the buttons have to be rubber . C: What is the normal material ? D: Yeah , I dunno . B: Plastic . C: Sh yeah . B: Plastic , I think . C: Classic ? B: Plastic . D: Plastic . C: Oh , plastic . A: Kay , but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . B: Yeah . C: But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes . A: Separately . B: Se no no no . C: And and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . A: Yeah , yeah . A: Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we yeah . A: It uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . D: No . C: No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it . D: Yeah , I really don't get it . D: I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . A: I think we can agree on this . A: I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . A: Cause I think we uh Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? D: Yeah , yep . C: But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . D: I think so , too . D: Oh , I don't know . A: Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . B: And then we can get a docking station . A: And maybe then we can do something extra . C: For For two Euros . A: Oh , n uh oh , still oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . A: Two . A: Then we have some money left . A: We can put then We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . A: Yeah , well who knows . D: Uh why ? D: I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . A: Or a little bit of tin titanium . B: But what what can we do But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? A: Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . A: That's also maybe an idea . A: Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . A: Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . B: If if i Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . A: Maybe is that that's nice to know . A: Yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature . D: I like the hand dynamo part . D: We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . B: Yeah . B: We'll go back uh tomorrow . D: I mean Wi wi without recharge Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . A: Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . D: I mean , it has a shape . A: Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , then two Euros isn't even possible . D: Of course it has a shape , but i i Why should that not be possible ? A: Yeah , then because then we'd thirty cents left . D: No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . A: Yeah , but yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . B: That's the question . B: If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f No . D: Yes . A: Yeah , and w and and we uh need f and what is this ? C: It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . A: Sample sensor sample speaker . C: It isn't in my information , I uh I I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or Uh I've got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it . A: You can look at it for s presentation . A: S technical functions ? B: No no , they were uh mine , yeah . A: Oh . C: When my mouse works again . A: Oh , oh oh . A: Hey . A: Oh . C: My mouse is uh Yes . D: Dead . D: Reanimate it . C: Oh . B: Died . C: Ah , I've got it . C: I will put uh my email on the the network . D: What the hell are these ? C: It's on it . D: Oh , whatever . B: Yeah , it's open . A: Mm . A: I don't think here it's in here already . B: It's circuit board . B: It's only just basics for for At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . A: It's nothing about s yeah . C: Yes . D: This isn't helpful . A: No . A: But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . A: Which one was it ? B: Components design . A: Functional requirements ? C: Um Yes , that was mine . D: No , that was my presentation . B: Components design maybe . B: N on top . A: Ah . A: Ah yes , it was the second one . C: But that was my second Mm But this is the same uh This is o only the possibilities . A: Yeah , it was your second your first presentation . D: It's already open . D: It's at the bottom . B: Working design . A: Sorry ? D: It's uh at your task bar . B: Yeah , but it's the the other one . D: Oh . A: Uh , this is n this is not this n that's not the right one . B: Was it working design or components design ? D: Sorry . A: I don't oh . D: Okay , sorry . A: No , this is the other one . A: Or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these Here . B: Chip set . C: Yeah . C: We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . D: Yeah , nice . B: The display requires an advanced chip . D: I it doesn't say anything . A: You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires Okay , so we only need a simple chip . C: Ah , okay . B: Requires . C: With the light . B: Little lights . B: Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED . A: No no , that's just a simple chip . D: That's not needed . A: A scroll-wheel it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . A: So , we don't need any of them . D: A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . C: L_C_D_ . D: For showing text . B: Yeah . D: I don't think that uh just a l a little light Yeah , I agree . B: No . B: I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . A: And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? C: Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , I guess so too . B: Yeah , true . D: Next channel . B: Well , that's not too what we want . D: No . D: Well , we might want it , but Yeah . A: Okay . C: All in twelve Euros . A: Back to the costs . C: Twelve Euros and fifty cents . A: So we're gonna use the simple chip . B: So , simple chip is okay . D: Great . D: Delete . D: Yeah . C: And the lights . C: Where uh are the lights ? B: Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no category . D: Well , there're three , I guess . A: Nah , there is some money left to be spent . B: Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? D: I think we can make a docking station . A: Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? D: Yeah . A: But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . B: Mm-hmm . A: I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . B: But it's original . A: But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . D: No , that's true . A: Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . D: M bu Or the hand dynamo dynamo Yeah . A: Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I they will think about that . C: But but sometimes you put a Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . A: I mean if you u The uh it's made for s people well , the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . C: Uh solar cells are useless . A: And i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . A: Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . A: Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . D: Yeah , but but if we ca I don't know if Five minutes . A: You don't use batteries . A: I've never seen it before in a remote control . B: But then we could make a docking station . A: No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway . D: That's not true . A: Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . D: We can make a docking station for two thirty . B: Wow , w why no li Look at now , we got two two thirty left . D: Two thirty . C: Fo for a docking station . D: We can make a docking station . B: Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? D: Sure . C: With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . D: Sure . B: I don't know . D: The power device is is i i is very cheap . D: That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . C: Wi with a button to wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . B: Well , we we uh Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . D: So . C: Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . A: I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . D: Well then it's a useless project . C: Look at the case , the case the case of of uh of uh No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . A: Oh , because we We well look at all the special stuff we have . A: Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . A: It th this is whole concept . A: Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . D: Can't we uh Can't we say fifteen Euros ? D: No , sta yeah I mean No . A: Uh , no . B: No , we only make less profit of it . C: It's the Maybe we can uh can do it both . D: You can sell for twenty seven and a half . D: Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . B: No . A: Yeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . D: I don't think No . C: Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . C: Battery and kinetic . A: No , that wouldn't n no . D: Thirteen twenty . A: Yeah , and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . D: And I think only Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . C: Yes , but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . A: No no . A: Yeah , it's great . A: No no no . A: No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . A: When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it It We can make it yeah no . C: You asked for three d No , that's n that's not true . C: Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . D: No . A: Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . C: Yes , solar cells are also stated . C: Why don't we use solar cells then ? A: Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah , but you don't have to . C: That's true . D: Yeah , it's funny for a week . D: I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . A: Trust me . A: The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . D: No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . A: Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . C: Oui . A: You m have to put something on your box . A: You have to make people buy it and uh We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . C: You can do it for fifty cents . D: Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . C: The c The case the case alone is is is uh the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . A: Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , because uh we only have a minute left or so . C: Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . A: No no , it's not possible . A: Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready . B: Cheap remote control . A: Yeah , we make some extra profit of it . D: Yeah . D: No , we won't , but that's um something else . C: But now Great . D: No , this not gonna sell . B: It w it won't tell , but No , uh , n no Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . A: Huh , any ideas ? D: No . D: Of course not . C: It's great . C: Our remote control . B: You have to do it over . D: We come back tomorrow , okay ? B: Yeah . A: No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . C: Yes . B: the No , but no . C: Seventy Euros . A: I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . A: That's what it's makes it special . A: Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . C: Why not a hand dynamo then ? A: Okay , well we leave it like this . A: Then it's c then we're yeah . B: Yeah , yeah . D: We can't do anything else . D: Warning , finish meeting now . C: We're done . A: Okay , project e uh well , we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet . C: Is this it ? D: Yeah , sure . C: Okay . D: No , we can't . A: Yeah , we have to Yeah , it's Uh , I don't know . B: No . D: Yes , yes . C: Yes . D: Celebration . D: I don't see why , but I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . C: Where's the champagne ? B: Yeah ? C: I don't uh hear a bell . D: No , not yet . D: Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . B: We can do it here then . C: Bye . D: I don't think so . B: Can we can't we do it here ? D: I don't know . D: I don't I don't think so . C: Uh-huh . C: Just fill that one in . B: Yeah , we're doing now . B: But it's . B: Oh , okay . B: Nice .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. The remote has buttons for power, mute, teletext, volume and channel up\/down, and nine numbered channel buttons. The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. The marketing expert led the product evaluation. The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. The overall score was 2.6. The group worked out the manufacturing costs. The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons, and did not know which kind of chip to use. They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting. The group will fill out a final questionnaire. The remote will use a simple chip. The remote will use a standard battery and not kinetic energy. The remote will not come with a docking station. The group could not agree what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. The could not decide whether the docking station should be adapted for use with other products. The group did not know how much the docking station would cost. They were not sure what kind of chip they would need or where to find this information. They were not sure how much the buttons would cost because they seemed too expensive. They were not sure whether they could afford the docking station. The project manager wanted to use kinetic energy but the others were not convinced. The group were dissatisfied with the final product. They did not have enough time to evaluate the project process.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the detailed design meeting, A led the discussion with participants B, C, and D, starting with a prototype presentation focusing on form, material, and color aspects of a remote control. They deliberated over the number and functions of buttons, debating the need for a mute button and the clarity of button labeling. The team discussed the necessity of a kinetic power source and a docking station, considering the financial implications of each component. Despite the desire for innovative technology like kinetic power, they settled on a simple chip for the remote control, aiming for a balance between cost and functionality. The meeting concluded with a decision to forego the docking station due to cost constraints, opting to focus on the unique design features of the remote control. Action items included finalizing the design details and considering additional features like a kinetic power source. The team celebrated the progress made, acknowledging the need for further discussions and decisions in future meetings.","relevance":0.5792163014,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"Who led the detailed design meeting?","answer":"A led the discussion with participants B, C, and D."},{"question":"What aspects of the prototype presentation were discussed?","answer":"The form, material, and color aspects of a remote control."},{"question":"What technology feature did the team consider but ultimately decide against due to cost constraints?","answer":"The team considered a kinetic power source but decided against it due to cost constraints."},{"question":"What was the final decision regarding the docking station?","answer":"The team decided to forego the docking station due to cost constraints and focus on the unique design features of the remote control."}]}

A: What the Uh Yeah well , ja well let's just start . D: Kay . A: I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . D: Right let's see it . A: So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . A: Well . A: Very nice . A: Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . A: So uh I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , and uh hmm . D: Kay . A: Oh sorry . A: And an uh a nice agenda . A: Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . A: I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . A: Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . A: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . A: So this the opening we'll uh We have to uh design a new television remote control . A: You have heard that uh already I think , so . D: Mm-hmm . A: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . A: Uh trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . A: And uh friendly , so size does matter . A: And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . C: Mm-hmm . A: Other uh There happen to be uh three stages . A: functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . A: Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . A: That's just it . A: Um We have uh these two Smartboards . A: Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . A: It just works exactly the same as a computer . A: You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . A: So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything . A: Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . A: This is a uh well a drawing board . A: you have a these different uh functions on the board . A: You can see them there . A: So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . A: This is just a . A: I want to uh Oh yeah . A: Of course w doesn't work any more . C: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it ? C: Yeah . A: Yes I will eraser so . C: It works . A: It's fantas fantastic . C: Wonderful . A: We can uh uh well you can save a file . A: So if uh we draw we have to save everything . A: Don't throw anything away . C: Mm-hmm . A: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . A: Just uh let them all uh stand here . A: We can delete , but we don't do that . A: Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . A: It's a bit uh childish you have to write . A: It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . A: Well it's just like a normal uh paint . A: So it's gone . C: Alright , yep . A: Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . A: So that's fantastic . A: Um well this uh speaks for itself . A: We going to try it . A: So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , not my idea . D: Alright , your favourite animal ? A: Yes our your favourite . A: So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , but I'm going d I'm not going to . A: I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast w I dunno what I'm going to design . D: Grizzly bear . A: Oh um doesn't oh . C: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . A: Yeah , 'kay . A: Hmm ? A: I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea . D: Yeah . C: I I I I understand . A: So what ? D: We're kinda losing time , though . C: Alright . D: We're losing time , but Alright . A: Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah . C: so start Yep yes . A: Sh I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh No so a a few legs . C: Don't uh count on it . D: Do we have to guess ? D: A hippo ? A: Yes yes guess . A: Well I should make it an hippo now . C: I think it's a mouse or a rat . D: Yeah . A: No I don't think so . C: Oh . C: Oh I know it . A: Well what is it , huh ? C: It's a hedgehog . D: I don't know how to call it . A: Yeah difficult English word . D: A hedgehog ? A: I didn't knew it myself . C: Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills . A: Our characteristics sum it up . A: Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing . A: So we can uh just uh We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . C: Yeah . D: Alright . C: I am the Industrial Designer . D: Thank you . A: Huh . C: Chief , I am the Industrial Designer . A: Oh uh but this uh marketing designer . C: Yeah . C: I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by . D: It's . A: what kind of animal is that then ? C: I think can I say it ? D: Yeah sure . A: Uh it . D: It's a rabbit . D: Well Looks very nice , right ? A: Yeah . C: It looks amazing . A: No no no . A: What are you going to do ? B: We want to erase it . A: No no . A: No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document . D: Yes . C: These are very impor These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . A: Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh and then save it and start an blank document . D: Yes uh right . D: You go man . B: Thanks . A: Yeah . A: There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . A: So um well you should uh try it but uh Well y y y you could have but uh . D: Alright . D: I should have made mine a white rabbit . A: It speaks for itself . A: What the uh just a duck . C: It looks like an uh It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . A: Nice . C: Yeah . B: Big bird . A: Is it a duck ? D: You're standing in front of it , I can't see it . C: It's it's uh Do we have to uh But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? A: Is it a plane ? D: Alright , thank you . D: Yeah it's a bird , but what kind of bird ? A: It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh . D: You have to push harder . A: Yeah just a bit a bit childish , a bit . B: Mm . D: Release your anger . B: Uh no I don't . C: No ? B: It's just a bird . C: Well wonderful . A: Well uh save the document and then uh And then a a new blank document for . A: uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . B: Here you go . C: Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? C: Uh pen yeah that's . A: No well first yeah . A: And then you go to format I think , and current colour you choose a new colour . C: Uh current colour . A: And a new pen width uh also format . C: I like uh oh they don't have pink . B: Mm . C: Oh b oh think this is uh Uh ? A: It's not like in paint . C: Uh Line width . A: Line width . A: And you can choose a nice one . B: Width . A: Width width . C: Uh fifteen . A: With each other . C: And I can draw ? B: Hmm . A: Yeah . A: So . A: Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy . C: Uh Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well . D: Hmm . A: Mm-hmm . B: It's a pussy cat . D: It's a cat . A: Oh Pussy . A: Well then you change it . A: And erase things . C: Uh . A: What ? D: It's a pig . C: It smiles nicely . A: Super pig . C: Now I have to change the line width . C: Uh one . A: So Yeah yeah yeah we know . C: These are whiskers , you know . D: Right . C: Uh well I think it's obvious right now . A: Yes alright . A: It's a cat . D: No it looks great . C: Miaow . C: Well if this isn't obvious I'll save it alright uh save . A: Well well um Yeah save it and start a new blank document . D: Just save it . C: Uh yeah uh blank . A: Yep . A: So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . C: Well I feel comfortable now . D: Oh great . A: Well it's terrific , eh ? C: Thanks for this exercise . D: It's good for group spirit . C: I feel totally at ease . A: Yeah that's it . B: It certainly is . A: We're one big happy family now . C: Yeah something like that . A: Well then uh the serious uh stuff . A: We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . A: Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . C: So Alright . A: So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . A: we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . D: Right . A: Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? D: Right . A: Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . A: We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? C: Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh Mm-hmm . A: Please ? A: No uh I did . A: Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then Yeah . D: I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . D: Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . A: Yeah yeah . D: On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . A: Yep . D: Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . A: That's alright . A: That would be a nice idea , yes . A: Yep yep yep . D: Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ? A: Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . D: Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it . C: No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . D: So Yeah . B: Easy to learn . D: Yeah that's right . B: Yeah . A: Yes . B: Yeah . A: I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . D: Mm-hmm . C: Alright . B: I also think we should not add too many buttons . A: Well yeah ? D: Right . B: Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think . A: No that's right . A: Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international . B: Precisely . D: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . B: Yeah . B: Yeah indeed . A: Yes . C: Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh And stereo uh s uh audio installations . D: Yeah right . A: Yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . A: Don't we have uh other uh ou Uh . B: Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? A: We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . D: Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yep . B: And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . B: So we can keep that in mind . C: Most people do , yeah . A: Well yeah . C: It doesn't it doesn't have to be Yeah . A: It doesn't have to be , but we can . B: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . A: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . D: Yeah but We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh Yeah but it's it has to be useable . B: Yeah alright , but Yeah . A: Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design Yes . C: Well . C: Hmm . C: It has to be different and familiar at the same time . D: Yeah . B: Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . A: Yep . C: yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . C: I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable . A: Yeah . B: Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and Yeah or so Well yeah it's new . A: Oo N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . D: No . C: Oval ? C: I Mm . A: So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . D: Not with two hands . D: Yeah yeah yeah , right . D: No Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . B: but young people want something different and it is Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . C: But you still have to know it's a remote and not another Yeah . B: Yeah alright . A: So the the form will have been uh tested out so Yes . C: Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful or else uh they would have been ano another shape . A: Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . A: I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . D: It shouldn't be boxy . C: Yeah . C: Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah . C: You have to use one hand . A: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . D: Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand . C: Why not ? B: Yeah it doesn't fit . A: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . D: Yeah . C: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have W no w what else ? D: Yeah but if you shape it If No that's ol old fashioned . B: No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . A: D_V_D_ players . A: Yes . B: They're all um Well Yeah . C: I di Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? D: I can imagine that us Well Yeah right . B: Yes uh Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . D: It fits in your palms . C: Hmm . B: Mm . C: Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box , yeah . B: Yeah it Yeah yea Hmm . D: Hmm ? A: Well A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . D: Um . A: That's We have five minutes left . C: It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . D: Well Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . C: Yeah yeah I understand , but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit . D: It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . D: It's No no no . D: Yeah . D: Yeah it should be Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and Right . C: Yeah yes I thought about something like that . C: Yeah . C: A big recognisable button on top or something . B: Yeah . A: So Yes uh that's yep . C: The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . D: But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . A: Yep . D: So there has to be some space between the buttons . C: Uh-huh . C: Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . D: Yeah . D: Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours . C: Yeah . C: Colours , yeah . B: Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but Well . D: Yeah . A: Ha . D: That's kinda trendy . D: Yeah right . A: Sound nice . A: Yes . C: I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um . A: Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . D: Right . D: But I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we Yeah . C: Already thought about something tha Mm-hmm . A: Yes ? A: Yes . A: Well thirty minutes we have . A: So um This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . A: You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . A: I think . D: No problem . A: Oh and uh that's uh that's all . A: So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . C: Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . A: Yeah yes say . B: Mm . D: Yeah . D: Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . C: No n n Mm . A: Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . B: Yeah that's bad , yeah . D: Yeah yeah yeah . A: So it has to be made in the buttons I think . A: It has to uh not be loose . B: Yeah that's important . C: Alright . C: And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other . A: Yeah . A: Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh It's not that in China it's different ? D: Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . C: I think so . C: It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think . D: Yep . A: Yeah . A: But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between Yeah . D: And you can use Yeah . C: It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . B: Yeah . B: But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so . A: Probably yes . A: China rules . C: And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . C: The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think . D: But are Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? A: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . D: I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? A: Yeah . D: You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy . A: Yes . A: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . B: Yeah . D: Right . B: Yes . D: Right . B: Yes . B: Mm . B: Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy . D: Yeah . C: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . D: Yeah right . B: Yeah alright . B: Yeah normal . A: Yes . A: Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so . B: No a colour everyone accepts . B: Mm . C: Pink television sets pink remote , . B: Mm . D: Yeah yeah yeah . B: Yeah . B: standard . D: But people of often don't like bright colours or something . D: We have to make it grey or s or black . B: Well young people s li Yeah yeah , yeah . D: Yeah but then you can use a a front . C: Alright . A: Yeah . C: I must not forget my pen the next time . A: Well if if you yeah . A: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . B: Yeah . D: Yeah that's right . A: I think . D: Yeah or a t Teletubby front . A: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . D: Yeah yeah yeah . D: I will investigate . A: Yes . A: Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . A: And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . C: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah . A: Or something like that . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Right . B: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get Yeah . C: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too . C: Y you went to the company website . A: Euro ? D: It's Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer Yeah . A: Well it it it's if you uh Finish meeting now . C: It's the the the start uh starting page uh Very handy to know . B: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it . A: Oh alright . A: Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . B: Yes . D: Well that's great . B: Next meeting is in Thirty minutes . D: Thirty minutes . B: Yeah alright it's it's handy to know Oh . A: I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size . D: It's totally broken . C: Right see you in half an hour then . A: Oh right , oh . B: Goodbye . C: W Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . A: Ma W that was a nice meeting . D: Oh . B: S . A: Yeah , see you .","summary":"After introducing the remote control objective, the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using. They tested it by drawing animals. The project manager informed the group of the budget, before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas. They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote. It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons. The considered options for the shape of the remote control, imagining how it would fit in the hand. The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues, and discussed remote covers. Individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting. The interface specialist will look at button and over all look. Specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting. They will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too. *NA*","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the project, the team gathered for a kick-off meeting led by the Project Manager, A, with participants B, C, and D. A demonstrated the Smartboard tools for collaboration and presented the agenda focusing on designing a new television remote control. They discussed the need for originality, user-friendliness, and international appeal, aiming for a \u20ac50 million profit with a target selling price of \u20ac25 per unit. Decision points included keeping costs at \u20ac12.50 per unit, exploring competitor remotes, and ensuring universal compatibility. Action items were assigned: D to research competitor remotes, C to work on the user interface, B to focus on the technical design, and A to handle the look and feel. The team engaged in a creative exercise drawing animals on the Smartboard, fostering team spirit. They concluded with plans for individual research and reconvening in thirty minutes, emphasizing the importance of noting decisions and maintaining a balance between innovation and practicality in the remote's design.

{"meeting_id":"TS3009b","dialogue":"D: Great man . D: Who starts ? A: Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . D: Alright , great . D: Alright . A: Okay . A: I've put some uh new things in the in the map . D: Mm-hmm . A: Uh oh . A: This is it . A: I don't know the shortcut , so Ah F_ five . A: Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . C: Mm . A: And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . D: Yes . A: Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . A: But uh Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . D: Kay . A: I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? C: Well , yeah . D: Yeah . A: Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno . A: Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? C: No . D: No . A: Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . D: You're the only one . C: Oh . D: Alright . D: Kay . A: Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . A: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . A: And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . C: We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? A: Uh Uh yeah , I think so . C: Alright . A: Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . D: Alright . A: Um now I'll look at show this board . A: Um Well uh notes , first meeting . A: Now . A: I gave a disc a a presentation . A: Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . A: So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . D: Right . A: We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . C: Huh ? A: Uh not too many one buttons . A: One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . A: And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . C: Yeah . A: Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . A: It's uh one of our ideas . A: Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it . C: Mm-hmm , now it's right . D: Yeah . A: The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . A: It should be uh recognisable at all times . C: It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . B: Mm . A: Yes . D: Okay . A: Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones . A: And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . A: Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . C: Mm-hmm . A: It's quite logical al all of it . A: Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . A: I got this mail from uh our bosses . A: Well , teletext goes out . B: Oh . A: We will not use teletext . D: Okay . A: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . C: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . A: Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . B: Oh . D: Alright . C: Oh , alright . B: Oh , that's a shame . A: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . A: Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . A: Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . D: Yeah . D: But let's forget about it . D: It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on . A: Yeah . A: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . A: So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . D: Yes . A: Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . C: Yeah , we are a real fashionable company . C: I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Mm . A: Yeah . C: So it has to be uh a modern design . A: Okay . C: That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . A: Yes . A: I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . A: It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . C: Yeah . D: Right . A: So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . B: Yeah . A: Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . D: Yeah . A: You want to start ? D: Yeah . D: I think I have to start . A: Oh you have to start ? A: I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . D: Oh no , no problem . C: The order ? C: No . A: Well s then start . B: Mm . D: I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . A: Okay . A: Well uh You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . D: I think it's this one . D: But I'm not sure . D: Hmm ? D: Yeah . D: S Right . D: Yes . D: This is it . A: Yeah . D: Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . A: Mm-hmm . D: Um to start with these points . D: Uh next sheet ? D: Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . D: Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . D: Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . D: So we have to focus on those three thing three things . D: And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . D: Well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . D: That's seventy five per cent of the current users . D: They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . D: Um They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . D: So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . D: Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . D: Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . D: So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . D: Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . D: Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . C: You can zap away . D: Yeah , yeah right . A: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Right . D: A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . D: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . B: Yeah . D: I dunno , maybe that's an idea . A: Well It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . D: Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . C: Oh . C: Oh ? B: Yeah . D: So Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? A: So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . A: No you can click it on your television . D: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? A: Yeah in another room , yeah . D: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . A: Well yes . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . D: So Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . A: Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . D: Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . D: So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . C: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . D: Yeah but people don't read manuals . C: Uh I didn't read it ? C: Oh , alright . D: No . B: No . C: users to uh add one ? C: Do you think ? B: I don't think Yeah . D: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . C: Yeah alright . A: Yep . C: Because they don't use it ? C: Alright . D: Yeah . A: Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short . D: Right . D: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . B: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . A: Yes okay . C: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? D: Alright . B: Yeah right . B: It sh it should be there , the manual . B: But but not to explain how the remote works . B: Only Hmm . D: And we don't have much time . D: So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . D: So you can pick up and use it , than I think . A: Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . D: Yeah right , right . C: Isn't it part of the of the u No . A: So Well we'll have a look . C: No . C: Never mind . D: Next point . A: Um yes ? D: Um R_S_I_ . D: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . D: But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ? C: Consider the m Yeah . D: Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . D: It should be a good in your hand . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . D: Right , this is the most important part . D: Um , we're Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . D: Um , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . D: Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . D: Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . A: Well Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh Yeah . D: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . C: It's going to be expensive . B: No . C: Yeah . D: Yeah but they think it's really important . D: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . D: We have to uh Yeah , I don't know . C: Well we'll uh consider it uh . A: Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know . C: We'll think abo we'll think No , we'll look we'll look into that later . D: I don't have any information on that . D: So Right . C: Alright ? D: And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . D: They also like that , but research is very uh costly . B: I think that's uh difficult to realise also . D: So Yeah , but it it might be important for the sale . C: We have very demanding clients . A: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so We sh Yeah absolutely . B: No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . D: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . B: Yeah . D: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . C: Yeah , yeah , alright . C: Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . B: No . D: Alright . A: Yep . C: We don't rule them out uh yet . A: Kay . D: Alright . D: Um , I think that's it . D: Um I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . A: Alright . A: Yes . D: So you can Right . A: Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation . D: Yeah . D: Right . A: It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next . A: You uh got uh Yes . C: Shall I give a technical talk ? B: Oh you go . C: Alright . A: Well go ahead . C: Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . A: Yip . C: We have that here . C: Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five . A: F_ five . A: F_ five . C: Yep . D: Alright . C: Well , the working design , that's my uh Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . D: Next button . C: So uh we have this . C: It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . C: It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . D: Oh right . D: Purple . C: But I think you can read it . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . C: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . D: A bit . C: Uh well you can see uh And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page . D: Maybe you can select it . D: So it uh inverts . D: the p the whole picture . D: Nah , uh never mind . A: Click . C: Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . B: Yeah , go ahead . C: Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . C: You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . D: Yeah . D: Alright . C: And uh the source is of course the user . C: Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . C: And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . C: That's the that's the basic idea . A: Yep . C: Very basic . C: Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . C: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . C: It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . C: The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . C: uh and recognise the key . C: So well you understand . C: The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . C: And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . C: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task . A: Yeah . A: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . A: And a button for T_V_ . C: Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . C: Uh we No no , but Yeah . A: So Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . C: Exactly . C: Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . C: I've some couple of pictures here . C: It's a very basic one . C: And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . C: It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . C: They're uh far enough apart and an anything . C: It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . B: High tech . C: Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . C: So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . D: Right . D: Can I say something ? C: Yeah . D: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . D: Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . D: Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately You don't have to look and and search for them . D: Right . D: Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . B: You can also like Yeah , I was thinking you can Are some of the the the um Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . D: Right . D: Yeah , right . A: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . D: Right . D: Yeah , that's right . D: That's right . D: That's right . C: Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course . D: We But Yeah . A: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . D: That's very important . D: And But is that is that useable ? B: Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ? A: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . D: Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? D: It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . B: Well Yeah alright , but Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . A: Well it it's Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Eighty per cent would . C: Well , . A: If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . D: Yeah , he feels it immediately . B: Yeah that's true . A: That's very irritating , I think . D: Yeah , that's right . D: Yeah . B: Yeah but Mm . A: Well . D: Right , continue . D: Sorry . C: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . A: No . C: I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . C: Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . A: Yep . C: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah , that's right . A: That's your part of the job . C: So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . A: Yep . C: And uh well that's about it I think . C: Oh yeah , I still have this . C: Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh don't look at it please . D: Alright . A: Okay . A: Well we understand . D: Alright . C: I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . A: We understand . D: Yeah , it's clear . C: Alright . A: Oh right , no . C: That's the most important thing . A: Nice . C: Alright . A: Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . C: Uh Right . A: How late is did we start his presentation uh ? D: I dunno . D: I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? A: Wha Yeah . A: Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . D: Losing time losing time . D: Yeah right . D: So I don't think so . A: So Oh yeah ? B: Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but obviously that's not the case . C: Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah right . A: Uh ? B: For instance you couldn't see this . A: Okay , yeah well . B: Um Yeah . B: Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer . A: Mm-hmm . B: The the method ? B: Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . A: Yeah . B: Um Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . D: These are already in use ? D: Alright , okay . B: Um This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . B: This one is user-centred . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: Um I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best . D: Well Yeah , me too . A: I like user-centred . A: Yeah . A: We also do that . B: Um Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . D: Mm . B: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . D: But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? B: But Yes . A: Yeah . B: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . D: Alright . B: Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . D: Yeah , right . B: I um I kinda like the shape . B: I think this is what we talked about . B: But No I've Well I showed it somewhere . D: Yeah . C: You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . C: But I think uh Uh you can draw it if you Yeah . B: Um Oh yeah . B: I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . B: So we can can uh yeah customise the Mm ? A: Mm-hmm . A: Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . A: So we cannot just uh make someone w No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . B: Yeah . B: It's a front . B: It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . D: But it Yeah , that's right . B: You can Mm . A: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . B: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . D: Yeah , that's a must . B: So l like Ericsson does every uh S something like this . D: We must have that . A: Yeah , we must . C: We can put it on the on the back side . A: Yeah well and and Yes . B: It's recognisable . A: Kay . D: We can make a symbol of the company right here . B: Um Yeah ? D: And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . D: So the symbol's always on Yeah . C: Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . B: Yeah yeah . A: Yeah yeah yeah . B: Something like that , in the Yeah . A: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . D: Yeah , yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: But let's not focus on the front . B: Yeah . A: Those kind of things . A: Yes . A: Okay . B: Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . B: If we we had to include more functions . B: But we don't . B: So um Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . D: Alright . B: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . B: Maybe some less . B: Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . B: I think uh Yeah , I will . C: Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? C: In Map ? B: I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . B: The less buttons the better the design . B: Um We should go with that concept I think . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , I agree . B: I know . A: Alright . D: I've I've got another point . A: Yeah ? D: Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . D: Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . B: Mm . D: They are high high interested in feature . D: But they are more critical . D: Fo Yeah , critical . C: The younger uh Mm-hmm . D: So The younger audience . D: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . A: Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . D: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually But Yeah I think m most Most uh Mm-hmm . D: Clip aren't used much . A: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not Yeah . D: Yeah right . B: Yeah , but what kind of features ? B: Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . D: Yeah but Yeah . B: But I've Yeah , that's nice . D: Here , look at these numbers . D: The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . D: Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . D: You see ? D: So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . C: Uh . C: Yeah . D: The concurrent ? C: Our competitor . A: Competitors . C: Yeah . D: Competitors , right . D: So , I do think we have to uh have some features . A: Yeah . D: Even though they cost a little more . A: Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . D: Right . D: Right . A: And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . D: Like a ticker-tape . A: Yeah . D: Which programme you are l watching or something . A: Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . A: And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . D: Yeah , right . C: Yeah . D: Yeah right . C: Yeah . C: So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . A: Yeah . A: For example . A: It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . B: Yeah , we should keep that simple too . C: But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . B: It will No , it should be uh integrated . A: Yeah . D: No not clickable . A: Well maybe . D: Nah , no no no . B: I think Yeah , something like on um some radios in car . D: Yeah , just at at the top . D: So when you s you sit like this you can can watch . D: I think it should be at the top . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . B: You Where it's , yeah , walking to Yeah . D: Yeah right . D: It's a ticker-tape idea . A: R_D_S_s or something . C: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . B: Wa Yeah . D: Well it's just one script . A: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah . D: Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . D: So I don't think that's the issue . A: No . C: Alright . D: Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? A: Uh well I think so , yes . B: Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . D: Kay . A: Um We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . D: Right , I don't know if I can find that , but Next time . B: Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah . A: Um we can use this board again , I think . D: Yeah right . A: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . A: Where is my presentation ? A: Uh Uh Well I mean we're all here now , I think . D: Yeah , I understand what you're saying . D: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . A: These I've already given you . A: So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . D: Right . A: So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . D: At the top . C: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? B: At the top or at the bottom ? A: Yes . C: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? D: I think the top is more uh When you s How do you zap ? C: Uh Huh ? A: Yeah . B: Yeah but Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . D: You just sit in your chair ? D: With the remote ? A: That thing is terrible . B: Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . D: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . A: Uh Well Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . D: Yeah , I dunno . B: Yeah , no Mm . C: And then uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . D: We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh No Um he thinks Yeah , right . C: I dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something . D: He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . C: Uh-huh . C: Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? B: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . D: But your Yeah . C: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . B: I c Well I d I think that's that's ugly but I th Yeah . D: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small . D: It's it's wide . D: It's not not high . C: Uh-huh . D: But Yeah right . C: And and we can Bottom . B: Power button always Yeah . B: Yeah . A: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . B: Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah . A: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window Yes but we we we we don't want that . D: But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know . C: Well that's a bit exaggerated . C: Well , I agree with you . C: It's it's also more recognisable . D: We High-tech . C: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . B: Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote . A: We don't want them to look like a calculator . A: We want to look it like our original but familiar Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ? C: Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because I think it's uh I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh it's more familiar that way . B: Yeah . D: Width . A: Width . A: Uh format yeah format ? A: Line width ? A: Width ? D: Th that's not a problem . A: Yeah ? D: When I draw here it Oh . D: Huh ? A: It's a bit off . D: Yeah , it's off . A: Well . C: A little a little bit . D: It it needs to be calibrated again . A: Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh It's special pen . D: Well Where ? C: Maybe you should another pen . C: Maybe that's uh better . C: You e you only have one pen for that screen . C: Yeah . D: Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . A: Yeah . A: No . D: Um I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . C: Yeah . C: I I agree . A: I think it should be at the button , bottom . C: Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so um Yeah . B: At the bottom ? A: Bottom . A: The L_C_D_ . B: In a few minutes Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . D: At the bot So We are two uh V_S_ two . A: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . B: He's the boss . D: Right . D: Great . C: Uh we uh we were busy with that . A: Because we have to decide this . C: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . A: Yeah . C: So , we have the power button . D: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . A: Yes . D: It's uh your it's your job . C: Yeah of course . C: Uh it's uh . B: No it's our job . C: Yeah . A: Well we have a power button . C: W wh While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . A: Guys ? B: For all of us I think . D: Yeah , right . A: Guys ? D: Alright , let's keep it central . C: Yeah . A: We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons Uh Yes . B: The ten numbers ? B: Yeah ? C: Channel , yeah . B: Volume ? C: Volume control . C: Um Well let's look at your uh design . D: Mm . A: Uh the mute button . C: Uh Uh-huh . A: I h love that one . B: I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ? A: Yes . B: Yeah , in circle , you know ? A: Yeah . A: Yeah yeah yeah . A: Well that's that's also design . B: And and a volume control also in it . A: Yes . D: Right . A: Um Well h ho Yes . C: Yeah . C: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . A: Yes . B: Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . A: They are for some uh video uh Apart . C: So Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . D: You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . B: Yeah . B: I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . D: Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true . D: When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . D: So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . A: So people have to move their hand . A: And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . C: Y Yeah . A: That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place . C: It's good to move uh from time to time . C: Yeah . B: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . D: Um Frequency of uh button use . A: Yes ? B: They they need to be centred . C: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? A: Well not Yes . D: Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . A: Uh-huh . B: Volume hardly . D: You can see . D: So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . C: Mm-hmm . B: No I don't think . C: Oh . A: Up and down far apart from each other ? C: Far apart ? D: You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? B: Yeah but Yeah but No . A: Well not too much . D: Y look at uh look at the frequency . D: Nei not too much , but Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . B: The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . B: So Well they are used four times an hour , so Power bu button should be left at the top . C: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . A: Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . A: Because I have someone But the buttons is way . A: So that one can be put away . D: But just Yeah . D: Right . D: Yeah . D: I agree . A: The power button can uh be uh uh Yes . D: And should and should be red . C: Yeah . A: Oh man , five minutes . A: Yeah , well five minutes left . D: Right , just make some decisions . A: Yep . D: The most important things we have to uh I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . A: Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? C: C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . C: Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . A: Well I have it here . A: Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . D: Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready . B: Mm . A: Yes . B: Yeah . C: Mm . A: Yes . C: Alright . A: Well the L_C_D_ . A: Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . A: So I think it's going to go to Mike . D: Yeah . A: But you will have to make consensus with . A: Well Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . B: Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so Alright . D: Nei . D: We're No We're deciding now , so Top or bottom ? A: That's a bit uh Yes . C: Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yeah . A: Yes it is . C: You say familiarity isn't important but Yeah d Yeah . A: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? D: Okay . A: Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? D: Yeah , right . D: Okay . A: Alright these functions . C: As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . A: The number f Well yes , that's alright . C: So that's that's enough . D: Yeah , okay . A: W the number function . C: Yeah . A: Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? B: No . A: How do you want it to do then ? C: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . B: Well just when you push a one one and No , if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Yeah . A: It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more . C: Oh , like that . C: Um They'd recognise it . A: Yes . C: Th that's the most That that's very easy . A: Alright so no button for that . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: No . C: Yeah . A: Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? C: I think these are the the most important functions . D: Do you still have the pictures over there ? B: Yeah . A: So No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh Well uh Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . D: Yeah , that's about it . D: You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one . D: You do need them ? D: Yeah , I know . D: But are we Alright , alright uh Now okay . D: Right . A: So just for a television is that all we need ? D: Yeah , it's most useable this way . B: Yeah . C: basic function . A: Teletext is gone . A: So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing . A: We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . A: Uh there's um screen . A: You can make it wider and less wide . D: Yeah . A: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . D: Right . D: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . C: Oh yeah . A: Those two ? A: But it's just two , and we make a clip ? C: Uh just two just two under uh under uh I I think uh But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . A: Th that's a bit uh waste . B: We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . A: Yes . D: Yeah . D: Okay , right . A: Or at the top . A: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . B: Or at Yeah alright then . C: Uh that's that's too complicated . A: Yes . C: You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . A: Yeah Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . B: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . C: Yeah . C: Yeah or at the top , yeah . C: What do you think uh those those buttons ? C: Above or down ? C: And w where ? C: Well we design it later . C: We have it , and we design later where everything goes . A: Yes ? A: Yes . C: Yeah . A: Yes . A: Well any other uh Go to video , that's always on your remote control . D: Well if you you take those th If you Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . B: Why go to video ? A: To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . C: The the video channel uh ? B: That's just zero . B: Yeah . A: Well l n no not at not at my remote . C: No no not always . C: Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . A: Yeah . B: Yeah , but you can can zap down Yes , I think th No , then you press ninety nine . A: Yes . A: I don't . A: I go to ninety-nine . D: Ah uh well whatever , . B: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but Yeah well y you must have . A: Th that's the button uh No . C: But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . A: No you can ch push zero . C: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh Yeah ? D: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . D: You have to set the channels . D: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to Ah , I do . A: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . C: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width . A: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those So we still have one uh four ? B: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh Yeah , alright . D: Right . D: That's the only one we put uh in there . D: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . A: Ch ch Okay . C: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah . D: Programme , right . A: Oh the Okay button ? D: Uh Ah . A: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . C: Yeah . A: Menu button . C: You should Yeah . C: I think that's important . C: Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . A: Channel , setting , menu . A: We have to go . A: Okay . C: Channel , yeah . A: So um Save . C: Chief ? C: Chief ? A: Yes see . C: Th the menu menu button is also important . C: Then you can uh Where ? A: Yes I have put it in . C: I don't see it . A: Here . C: Oh Menu , alright . B: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . C: In the menu . C: And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . B: Yeah , the Or the volume or something like that . C: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . A: Alright . A: Guys ? C: Yeah . C: Or the volume , yeah . A: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . B: Your pen . D: Great . A: So Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh Lunch . C: Yes chief . D: Alright . B: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? C: Yeah this is this is your thing . D: Ah . B: Yeah , lunch break . D: Okay . C: I am hungry . D: Get into my belly . A: Ah . C: See you later mate .","summary":"There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 30. It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up\/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting. Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting. The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual. The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself. The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive. The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up\/down. There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers. The power button will be placed at the top separately. The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones. A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements. Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet. There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote. No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)? A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off their functional design meeting, the team, consisting of A, D, and C, delved into the agenda, focusing on new project requirements received via email.

A: I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . A: So this time we exactly know what to decide about . D: Alright , great . A: And then we'll close again . C: Alright . A: Uh Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . A: We'll first look at your uh presentations . C: Mm-hmm . A: Alright ? A: Walter will uh start again this time ? D: Yeah , great . A: Yo . D: Alright , Trendwatch . A: Kay . D: Right . D: I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . A: Kay . D: Uh the trends . D: It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . D: Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . D: That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . C: Mm-hmm . C: Alright . D: And uh the feeling has to be very great . D: Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . C: Alright . D: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . D: This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . A: Less . D: Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . D: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . A: Well , yeah . D: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh Right . A: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . D: Uh the last point is easy to use . D: Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . D: I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . C: Easy to use ? A: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . D: Yeah ? C: I think that's your ta Mm . D: Yeah , I know . A: Well we have to choose one of them . D: I think we have to go for the first one . A: Yeah . D: It's the most important one . D: So we have to uh take that one . A: Okay . D: So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . B: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . D: But it has to look great . A: Yeah . A: We'll we'll look at uh . D: We'll see . C: You Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . D: Yeah , right . D: But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept . C: Alright . A: Kay . D: Alright . D: Uh these are the new colours of this year . D: So it must be very bright , very colourful . D: People like this . D: So we we have to think uh in this direction . D: So i set your mind to it . A: So Well Yeah , well Yeah . D: Findings ? D: Fashion update ? D: Fruit and vegetables are cool . D: I am told . C: Uh you think ? D: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . D: So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . B: Bananas . D: Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . D: I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . C: Mm . D: And that's uh also for the younger public . A: B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . A: Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . D: Yeah , that's great . B: Yeah . D: But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . A: Yes . D: So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . C: Mm . A: Yep , alright . D: Well , the don'ts . D: Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . D: Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . D: So uh we're gonna turn that around . D: We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . C: Alright . D: Right ? A: Wood is popular . D: Okay . A: Aha . D: We don't want wood . C: Yeah , among the old people , yeah . A: Yeah yeah yeah . D: Old people . D: So , that's it for me . A: Alright . A: Nice , uh well show us . C: Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . C: Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . C: This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . C: And the materials ? C: Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . C: But uh the case ? C: Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . C: But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . D: Yeah , we should change that . C: It should feel strong . C: So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . C: We should move to uh something Well yeah . A: Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . A: So maybe But we still have to look at our price of course . C: Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . D: No no no . C: So Yeah . A: Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh Yeah ? C: Also Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: But we'll return to that . C: Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . C: And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . C: The chips made of silicon , I guess . C: I think that's the best uh way to do it . C: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . C: Then I've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . C: Uh the target audience product style . C: Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . C: They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . C: But of course that's not our uh things this . C: So this is things we must not do . A: Yes . C: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . C: Um under forty five years old . C: Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . C: Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . D: Mm . D: Yeah . C: But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . B: Yeah . C: And also they like curved round shapes . C: So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . C: And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . C: But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . A: Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh ? B: Soccer fronts . B: Mm . C: Mm . A: That's nice . B: Hmm . C: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . A: All the results ? D: We keep coming back to the fronts . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . A: Mm-hmm . C: We have these kind of things . B: Hmm . C: I don't know what exactly they are . C: It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . A: Nai . A: Uh no . C: You also uh see uh this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . D: Fruity . D: Fruity . C: Yeah , it uh That's true . A: It's t terrible . A: Alright . C: And uh well round shapes , primary colours . C: You can see it all here . C: And of course uh this famous device . A: Hmm ? C: I think as you know something uh some devices like this . A: Yeah , alright . C: So to give you an idea of uh This has a strong look . D: Well it's got a strong look , this . C: Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , it still has a strong look . A: Yeah . A: And it's round . C: That's uh Yeah . D: But then you are losing your fruity colours . C: Well we have to make a Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . A: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . D: That's true . A: So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . C: I don't think that's very practical , but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . A: No , it isn't . A: Okay . C: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . D: Yeah but the But it doesn't have to look strong . A: Yes . C: Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but The feel ? D: The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . D: The feel . C: Uh alright . C: Well Mm-hmm . A: So , if you ti Well You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . B: And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . D: Nah yeah the feel Right . B: Only the feel . A: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . B: Oh . D: I agree . C: And I Then I have some more findings . C: Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . C: I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . C: But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . C: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much . A: No titanium . C: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . C: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . C: That that's the information I received . C: If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . A: What do you exactly mean with double curved ? C: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . C: And uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . C: Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . C: Uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but I'll draw it , but maybe later . A: Double curved ? D: I dunno . B: Yeah . A: It it mean Yeah , well okay . B: Yeah . C: And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . C: Um anyway Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . C: No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . C: And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . D: Yeah right . C: Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . C: But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . C: But It's worth the trouble I think , because Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . A: Well This soft material thing from uh Yeah . B: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . B: Because people like that . D: Yeah . C: Uh soft enough . B: Yeah . D: Right . B: Right . B: Yeah . C: So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . A: Alright . A: Okay . A: We will take that . A: And then uh Mike ? A: Okay . B: Yeah . B: Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . B: Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . B: Um we must decide where , this meeting . B: Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . B: And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . A: Oh That's interesting . B: Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . B: So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . C: Oh , yeah , I understand . D: Oh okay . C: Yeah . A: Okay . D: Right . A: But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . B: No it doesn't does not do anything . D: No . A: Oh . B: But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap . A: That's a bit uh Yes . D: But that that makes it cheap . D: It's it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap . C: Yeah . A: I understand . A: But it has no functionality for our remote at all . D: No but Yeah , right . B: No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . C: But it it's n nice for young people . D: Young people love them . B: Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . C: They like gadgets . D: Yeah , ple Right . C: Yeah . C: If it's cheap . A: Hmm . B: Um Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . C: Yeah . B: Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . A: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? B: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . B: Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . B: For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . B: A voice recognition can be uh implemented . B: And uh I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . D: Alright . C: Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ? D: How How How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? B: Hmm ? A: Ah . B: Well I have the I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . B: I didn't tick the note bo box in the . C: Mm . C: Alright . B: Um Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . D: Alright . D: So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . A: But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . D: Yeah right . B: Yes . B: Um I shall draw this . C: button , yeah . B: If it uh works . A: Just uh There is already a blank . A: Yes ? A: So Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Mm so have I . B: Nah . D: You have to push hard . C: I suggest a banana shape . C: Because of the fruity uh fashion . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: No m Next year that's out . C: Yellow and Yeah alright , yeah . C: Just a hunch . B: Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . A: Yeah . C: Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? B: Yeah just uh the numbers . C: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? B: These these will be bigger in the the real design . C: Alright , yeah . B: This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . C: Mm-hmm . B: And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . A: Yeah . D: You've Right . A: Yes . A: And what's the menu button ? D: And you you need a you need a speaker . B: Um it's Hmm ? D: For the Yeah . B: This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but Yeah . A: But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? A: Yeah . A: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . C: Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . C: By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . A: Uh Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . D: Yeah . C: It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . C: Yeah ? C: Yeah ? B: Ah right . C: Yeah . B: Well you you No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . A: And Well that's also the Okay button . C: But you can men you can press menu again to get out . A: That's you you should have uh Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . C: No . D: Exit . A: Exit . B: Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . A: Well , it's just a choice . B: You have uh redundancy . D: But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . D: Or don't Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . B: Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . C: Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? C: Where would you put it ? B: Well they that could be anywhere . B: That's very small . B: It could be uh down here . C: Uh-huh . B: Um . B: Well , not here . B: I yeah I suggest here . B: But that's just a little gap . C: Microphone , yeah . B: Yeah . B: Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . C: Yeah I understand . B: Yeah . C: Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . D: Alright . B: Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . B: But This is my suggested design . A: Huh ? C: Alright . D: Alright . A: Yeah ? A: Okay . A: Well , okay , alright . B: Um Yes . A: Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . B: And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . A: I'd I agree . D: Yeah , fine . B: But Oh , um I had some uh examples . A: Fine . D: Move on . C: Well yeah yeah yeah . A: Yeah . C: I can live with it . B: You can uh But I did not like it very much , but Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . A: Yes ? A: Too big . D: Yeah . C: They do they don't look fruity enough . B: Um No , well th Yeah . D: Nei They're n they're not trendy . A: They're all black . B: Well not all . A: Hey , that one I like . B: Uh this is for children but th No . C: Tho Yeah those But it doesn't uh the Yeah , ok Yeah . D: It doesn't look strong . A: No . B: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . A: The remote . D: Yeah right . B: Well this is a terrible Um this looks Yeah . A: Terrible . D: This is just crazy . A: It's it's all too much buttons . C: But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? A: Too many buttons . A: That's Well , that's too expensive I think . B: This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . B: I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but I don't know uh Too expensive ? D: Nah th It's too expensive . D: Yeah . B: Alright . B: Well Nah . C: But it Yeah . A: Alright . A: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Ha , even more . A: Huh . B: N Well Yeah , this is what we've just done . A: Mm no . D: But are we going for a strange uh form ? A: Kay . A: No , not very strange . D: Cause people like that . C: Not not too strange . D: Not too strange . C: No . D: You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . A: It still has t Yes . A: Th a a kind of bridge . A: So it f falls over the hand . D: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . A: Yeah ? A: Yeah ? A: Yeah . D: You know ? A: Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . A: It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . A: That's It feels comfortable . D: Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . C: Exotic yeah . D: Yeah , different . C: We have t Yeah , yeah . A: Yeah . C: I will design it , we design it later . D: Y yis Alright . C: So we'll get to that later I guess . D: Great . A: Yeah , alright . A: Um where did I put it ? C: The specific shape . A: Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . C: The Our sources . A: I got this from our friends . A: So Uh yeah the conceptual design . A: These are a few examples which we have to decide about . A: All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . A: Um Yeah . D: Your bag . A: Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? A: Um where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . A: And um B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . C: But uh we should decide now . A: Yes , but we have to decide about these now . B: Right ? B: Ah right . D: Yeah . D: Materials are the most , most impor Yeah . A: And uh the trend-watching . A: So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . A: Wow . A: Uh these things . C: So we have to uh put it in one uh document . A: Uh yes . A: Um so if we uh go through them Yeah well uh Why should I uh Yeah . C: Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . C: Yeah . B: Not everything . C: Well we have to decide all these things ? B: Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . C: W we can uh override them ? A: So What what kind of properties should it have ? C: Well a case ? C: Uh that's me . C: Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ? A: Well we just listened . B: I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . C: Uh s solid , yeah . C: Yeah . D: Do you know the new uh No no The front is the most important . B: That Just like um most cell phones are . C: Yeah , I understand . C: Yeah . C: So we have titanium . C: Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . B: Yeah . A: You know what ? C: And then the front is made of plastic . C: And you can put that on and off , and switch it . B: Yeah . D: But the feel of plastic isn't strong . C: No but you have titanium of course . B: No but you you have this Yeah . C: Uh you have the best of both worlds . D: Yeah alright , alright . D: Kay . B: Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . B: So you feel titanium . C: And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . C: But you also have the titanium . D: Yeah . D: Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas Yeah , but it it's expensive . B: Yeah . C: Yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a decision . B: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . C: I guess so . C: Uh titanium I sh I think uh Huh ? B: Yeah . D: Bendable . D: Bendable . C: Well , well the According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . B: Well any colour Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . D: Yeah . C: Mm . B: The plastic is is the colour you want it . D: Paint spray . C: Mm . D: Yeah alright . B: So Yeah . D: So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? A: Alright . A: I've uh Titanium back , plastic front . C: Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off . B: Mm . A: Okay . A: Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . D: Yeah , great . B: Yeah . A: I Um solid feel and trendy look . C: Alright . A: So material , um hard plastic for the front ? C: Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . D: Yeah . C: For the non-removable uh part . D: But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . D: When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . C: Well but The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't uh curves . D: You know ? B: Well titanium is neutral . C: No uh I nei . D: I understand . C: Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . D: Yeah , yeah , yeah . B: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Alright . C: I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much . B: Well Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood . D: Yeah . D: Alright . C: And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh People like mm colours that don't match . D: Funky customers . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Alright . A: Okay . A: And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh . C: Cop copper uh material . B: Yeah . C: Excuse me ? B: The electrical cable uh does No we don't use an electrical cable . A: It's uh from uh our coffee uh Of course . C: Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh Yeah in Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh Oh external ? B: Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . B: Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . D: Nei . D: So external . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja . C: Never mind the coffee grind . A: Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . A: So The chip is normal silicon . C: Right ? A: Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . A: Okay ? C: Alright . A: So that's just easy . C: Mm-hmm . A: Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . A: The conceptual specification of the user interface ? A: Um well we have our beautiful drawing . B: Well I got a better one here and I will um The shared folder . D: Alright . A: Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report . B: I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . A: Yes , you can Mm yeah . A: You can uh put some uh which button is what . B: Yeah yeah yeah . A: Okay . A: Um the trend-watching included these days . A: And what do we ? A: We thing that fruit and bright colours are Yes . C: Yeah the the the front w Mm-hmm . D: I think we can launch a couple of packages . D: You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . B: Yeah . D: So And you can you can Yeah right . A: We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . B: Yeah that's the whole idea of the front . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Uh those kind of things . B: Yes . B: But that's for later on . B: The fronts y you can do anything with them . A: Yeah . D: Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini Yeah . B: Yeah , right For the uh initiative uh launch . C: For the for the launch , yeah . D: It's good marketing . B: Mm . A: Launch different lines at once . C: So e th then a c couple of basic colours . C: Not not very uh sim Not Yeah . D: Yeah , n not too heavy . D: You can always take another pick . A: We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . D: They have to buy it later on . B: Oh yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah right . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Come on . D: More basic . A: We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: Very boring , yeah . B: Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . C: The most boring fronts possible . A: The most ugly . D: Yeah , right . A: Two . C: Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and uh And uh Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . B: Yeah . B: Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Alright . A: Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . A: Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote . C: Because yeah we have the sketch but Alright , yeah . D: Yeah . D: But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . A: Yes . D: Else it w won't sell . D: So Lost my mouse . A: Yes . A: Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get Where is my mouse ? A: Uh where is my mouse ? A: Oh yeah . A: Um this is it . D: Unbelievable . A: Well , um this we have . D: Yeah . A: Uh basic stuff . A: Interface we have . A: Supplements , L_C_D_ . A: Maybe a a cheap voice recording . A: Well Yes . B: Yeah we should do that . C: The price ? A: Alright . A: Individual actions . C: We all agree on that . C: Yeah . B: Mm . A: Industry designer , . A: User Interface , Mike . A: You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . B: Yeah , we can do that . C: Together or uh Yeah together . D: Yeah togeth You can take the SMARTboard . C: How Yeah yeah , but how do I Some Some non functional tasks . A: That's what I got uh to hear . B: But bu we stay we stay here or something ? A: Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . A: But I think so . A: Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it This is the SMARTboard , so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . B: Ah right . B: And take it to our rooms and uh Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . A: Yeah . A: So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . A: Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation . D: Have fun . A: So um , what are you going to do ? D: Kay . A: Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . D: We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult . A: Yeah . A: That's why I uh But uh How long do we still have ? C: You're fired . C: No but Well , can we talk about something else ? C: Uh Uh no I don't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah ? A: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Ajax . B: Um Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? D: Nah . D: Um round . C: Round I think . D: Yeah . B: Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah . D: Round . C: To make it as uh as round as possible . B: And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle . A: Why does Ah f fuck you . D: Curvy . D: Yeah . D: So you can see you have to up or down . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: But now I see the Well th th th th th that depends uh . D: And this must be uh volume I think , and this programme . A: Heh ? B: Mm . B: Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . A: We can't get Ts It doesn't work any more . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , it depends , but If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . C: Well we uh We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . D: Yeah , that's right . B: Yeah . B: Yeah alright . D: Yeah . D: Okay . A: We can't save them . A: So we'll just have them uh standing there . D: Yeah , I noticed . D: You can't uh click the corners . A: No . A: It's a bit uh bit a pity . D: It's a real real great thing . A: Well we still have uh more than five minutes . A: Um So what are we going to do ? A: I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . D: Let's start the design . A: Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote . C: Well yeah . B: Mm . C: Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be Yeah , why not ? A: Also the slogan ? A: On the We put the fashion in electronics . C: If there's enough space , you can put uh We'll we'll Well , our slogan is not very long . B: Uh I I'd say only the logo . D: O Yeah . D: Me too . B: Too much text and it gets too too busy . C: It's just a simple What is it ? B: Well it's quite a long phrase . A: We put the fashion in electronics . D: But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . C: You c But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . D: So Yeah , right . C: The logo and the and the Yeah they do . B: Ah the logo should be on the top I think . D: The logo Yeah . A: On the top . A: Yeah . A: Well in in in the right top corner ? C: Well yeah . B: Right corner , yes . A: And well you c On the back , you can put uh h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the Yeah . C: Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? B: uh the text ? B: Yeah . D: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . A: Just just small . B: Uh yeah , at the back ? C: Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . B: Well you c Well uh Yes . A: Yeah well Carved into the material . D: Yeah . B: You can The logo can be on on every uh front . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . D: It's better if you have it uh Yeah . B: Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something . A: No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . C: I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . C: But am I the only one , or uh No not on the front , but on the backside . B: Yeah , on the backside . A: Well , management would like it . B: Well n n not not on the front side , I think . A: The front side , no no l no slogan . B: On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there . C: Uh I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . A: Sorry . B: Yeah . D: I agree . C: To make more uh of an impression . D: But not too big . D: Just uh Yeah . C: Not too big . C: No , very small . C: Not on the entire back , but uh just very small . C: But readable enough of course . D: Okay . A: Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh ? C: But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . B: Yeah I think over here the logo . C: Lo Uh yeah . C: Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . A: Hmm ? A: Uh when changing fronts . A: Alright , that's decided . C: Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? A: Five minutes left . C: O on the front ? C: Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . B: Yes we could No , they have two fronts , that . C: So Yeah . A: So a bit of titanium between ? D: Yeah . C: No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that This enti entire bottom ? A: That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool . D: No no no no . D: You have to make this titanium too . B: You you can Yeah . A: No ? B: Yeah . D: Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Yes . D: Like dust in it and so things like that . B: Yeah . D: When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . A: I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile . B: No , you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . C: And then the lower part is titanium ? B: This is titanium . C: I think that's nice , yeah . D: Yeah . B: And this is uh F front . D: Some some kind of wei weight in it . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Round forms . C: Yeah . C: I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: With the with the curved edge . A: Yep . C: Maybe you can show it . B: Yeah . C: It also has the those two distinct uh Mm bit like this . B: Yeah . B: Tada . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . C: Uh it's uh Yeah yeah . D: Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . A: What ? B: Ah . C: That uh Yeah . A: So round where ? D: So uh a little corner of titanium . C: Maybe a nice touch , yeah . B: Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need . A: Oh , yeah . A: Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . D: So this this is the exchangeable part . C: I think I'm going to buy it . A: We want it . B: Yeah , this is the front . A: And it's only f twenty five Euros . A: Come on . B: This is the My design . C: That's a bit too much , but No , no no no , but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . A: No that's nothing . A: The Phillips remote uh costs more . C: Of course , because it's my design but No our d our design , alright . D: Right . D: Taking all the credit . A: Well uh you two are going to work together . A: You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh you uh Well I think we can , I just It's Yeah , o Oh Oh , we have a one . B: Yeah . B: We'll stay here I guess ? D: But there's a problem . D: We can't uh take a blank one . D: Or can we ? B: Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . D: Yeah . B: Uh the fourth one . D: Nah that's alright , that's alright . C: But don't erase my cat . B: Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? B: Yeah . C: I want to preserve it . D: This one is empty . B: Yeah . D: You have to empty one huh ? C: What are you doing chief ? A: So , you can uh draw a Yeah . D: Alright . B: Yeah I think we have to wait ? A: Well I'll get a I'll get the message . C: Yeah until the until the beep goes . D: No Yeah . C: But I don't uh Do we have to stay here , or I think we have to return first . A: No , I think uh Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . B: Maybe . A: Or get your mouse . A: Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . C: The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah . D: Yeah . D: It's not relaxing . A: I always have a mouse next to my laptop . A: I hate these Ugh . D: I I don't have a laptop . C: Yeah , touch-pads , yeah . C: We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . D: Yeah right . C: No just kidding . B: Yeah . D: Dream on . C: Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy . A: And in your remote control . A: So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . B: Aha . B: This has no function . D: Half No . A: Yeah . A: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but But they do want some gadgets . C: But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so Yeah . D: It's all about cool things . A: So that's wha what we're doing . D: And it will sell . D: We will be rich . C: Bless you . A: Well we won't . A: Our bosses will be rich . C: Mm . B: We've done too much in the previous meetings . C: Too much ? B: Yes , we've got nothing to do now . C: Well they uh I think that's good . A: Well , that's not bad , is it ? D: No . C: We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things . A: Mm . B: Its the best remote ever . A: So Oh . B: Pinball . A: Oh he's totally off again . A: Well But when I start here , it's here . D: No man . D: You just have to push harder . C: Yeah you have to push harder . C: Mm . A: So is it Nope . D: Yeah . B: Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , and I don't think that's Hmm . D: Mm . D: Recalibrate it . C: Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . D: Yeah . B: We can better uh draw a design on this . C: Yeah , maybe . B: Yeah , but we can't . C: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh goes off again . A: Yeah . A: Let's go . B: Well We'll stay here ? D: Finish meeting now . A: Finish the meeting now . A: Alright now we know what to do , so Um Message ? D: Yeah . D: Oh . B: Or we'll get the email . C: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? A: No , get away . C: Huh ? C: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Guess so . A: Um I I'm not sure . A: Maybe you Yeah . A: Well you'll have to work on this one . B: Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email . A: Yeah . A: That's a good idea . D: Alright . D: Have fun lads . A: Well Good luck . B: Yeah . C: A happy hol happy holidays .","summary":"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. The team drew a provisional prototype. They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched. The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons. The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product. The push buttons are going to be made of rubber. The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design. Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device. The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons. TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them. They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks. The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons. Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium. The chip is going to be a standard one. They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion. The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back. The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures. Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it. The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions. Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter. They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to finalize the design aspects of a new remote control device. The participants included A, the project manager, D, C, and B, who shared insights on trends and design elements.

C: We'll see . A: Very interesting . A: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . C: Yeah . A: Then um I guess that's your bit ? D: Yeah . A: I I didn't s see anything about it , so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that . A: So the you're uh . A: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . B: Mm . C: Yeah , that's important too . C: Yeah . A: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . B: Bit late . A: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . A: Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . C: Alright . A: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes . A: I don't think it's very interesting . B: I think it is . A: Oh nei . A: Uh no . A: Alright . A: This is copy paste . A: So Of course . C: From me of course , yeah . A: You had some very strange layout . C: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . C: Yeah . C: It's a nice chorus , yeah . A: Well um We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . A: And uh I summarised what you said to us . A: So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . C: Repeat it yeah . A: So uh This is what we decided . C: Alright . A: It's also copy paste from what we made together . A: So we still know that . D: Okay . A: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . A: Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . C: Alright , we both uh will ? A: Yeah . C: Or one of us will ? B: Alright . C: Uh Alright . B: No you go and I'll uh supplement you . C: If I make mistakes uh you'll uh Right . B: Yeah . A: Correct . C: Uh well this is our design . C: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . C: With uh the different uh perspectives of it . C: Uh we'll begin uh with the front . C: We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . C: Um with uh the upper part being the front . C: Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front . C: And uh we're we're using different colours . C: Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . A: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . C: Fancy colours . C: Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device . C: Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . C: You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . C: Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . A: Mm . B: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but It's a double R_ . C: Yeah ? C: It's a double R_ . C: Yeah the logo Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . B: But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah . A: Yeah , alright . A: Okay . A: Yeah . C: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . C: Then we have the buttons . C: Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . B: Oval yeah . A: Alright . C: So uh oval , n those are here . C: And then we have the m The m Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . B: Channel up and volume ? C: Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons . C: And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . C: We have the Okay button . C: Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . C: And then we've here the Menu button and the And the video button . A: Alright . B: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . C: The Yeah . D: Mm right . A: So 'Kay . C: And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . C: Uh this is what we made of it . C: You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . A: Well if I look at it , the side the side view Oh yeah alright . B: Well , at the back Yeah . C: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions . C: Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . A: Yeah . C: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? B: No the back . B: With the logo and our uh l uh No I don't think And the And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Well , it won't be visible . C: Yeah the back . C: Yeah . C: We thought about Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . C: And we thought about the logo big in the middle . A: Mm-hmm . C: Just so again the double R_ . C: We have then the logo on front and on the back . D: Mm-hmm . C: Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . A: Okay . C: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: That's basically what we were thinking about , and Oh and uh before I forget . A: Okay . A: W Well I see , but Well . C: Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . A: Yeah I see it . A: Yes . C: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . A: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . B: Mm ? A: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . C: Why ? C: Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , mean uh the the the the In the middle in the That's the question . A: But Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , I agree . B: If y If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . B: You you have it a bit uh Yeah . D: It depends on the size . D: If it's kinda small , this is is great . D: But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . A: And how large is it ? B: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's the question . C: Uh well Yeah . C: H What do you suggest I mean we do ? C: This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . A: Well uh Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh ? C: But now you have a totally different . B: Well , they lay there all the time . C: The size ? C: Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean Side ? A: They the the the the the side view , we didn't uh Yeah . C: Uh oh the side ? C: W we we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . B: Yeah yeah . C: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . C: Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea . D: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . D: You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . D: And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . C: But you you hold it like this . B: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , you you Yeah . C: You're not holding it like this or something . C: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? C: Yeah . C: Well y y y you don't have it like this . C: You have it more like this . A: No no no . C: You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . D: Like you're holding your telephone . A: Yep . C: So you Yeah . D: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . C: So Yeah well And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so Well Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but If necessary . B: Hmm . B: That way , it it falls into your hand . B: I think . A: Okay . D: Yeah , I agree on this . D: No , I don't think so . D: That's not uh the point And you might be uh You might be target customer . B: No but but Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . A: Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . A: Yes . A: So uh I c I c Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . C: But uh are d Can you live with it ? C: Uh Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . B: Yeah ? A: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should No No , when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh No not totally . C: But do you But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . C: I think . C: Not totally , well Yeah but of course y you are also human . A: For me , I I wouldn't buy it . A: Let's say it like that . C: We have to take uh every everyone into account . A: No Yes but Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . C: So Yeah . C: Well uh who who else thinks like you ? B: Mm . C: We don't know . C: Maybe a thousand people , or a million people . A: So let it be like this at uh at this moment . C: Let it be . C: Alright . A: Okay ? C: So that's that . C: Uh any other suggestions ? A: No , I think it's great . D: Yeah . B: But what about the redesigning ? A: Comes to that later . B: Okay . A: Um you . A: Uh c You can uh Walter . C: You're very personal again . A: You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? D: Alright . D: Great . A: That's more useful than just speaking . D: Well , this is just a short intro . D: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . A: Yes . D: That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . D: So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . A: Mm-hmm . D: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . D: Well , I put some questions in a Word file . D: See if I can find them . D: Uh uh uh uh mm . A: Kay . D: Well I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . B: Hmm . D: Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? D: Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . D: Seventy five percent of them . D: So what do we think ? C: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very Yeah . B: Mm . A: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . D: Yeah No , I know , but I have to uh evaluate it . B: Well we designed it to be good-looking . D: So I have to take this questionnaire . C: So and we ha we have answer now ? A: To the customers ? A: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? D: Yeah Yeah , but I can't can s Yeah , but uh , you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . C: Yeah . A: Nei . A: Oh no . B: Hmm . A: I know , I know , I know . A: But um Well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . A: Uh do we find it good-looking ? A: Well we think so . C: I Yeah , I think it Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . A: Uh Yeah . B: Yeah . B: We designed it to be good-looking , so Hmm . D: So But we have to be critic critical about it . D: And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . D: So we we know where we stand . A: Well , one . D: Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . A: Well so it's point four . D: Right , so Right . A: Easy to find t Two . D: Uh is it good-looking ? C: Well , I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . C: That was our target audience of course . C: But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . C: Uh it's it's not f a device that Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . D: The titanium might be uh f for older people . D: It you put uh put a black front on it or something . C: So Uh no . C: I think Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . C: So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people . D: Right . B: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah . D: Right . A: No . A: I totally agree . C: Yeah , the fourteen yeah . A: We we have to get get on , go through this . D: Right , a number please . B: Yeah . C: Is it easy to t change channels ? C: Yeah well I think so . D: So the last one is seven . D: Easy to change channels ? B: Um , no it's uh With two huge buttons . A: No , not false . A: It's one . D: Oh , sorry . D: Yeah , right . A: Well uh two ? D: Change channels ? A: Y Well we have to go through it . C: I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . C: Uh So I Yeah . D: Right . C: You How can you make it any easier ? D: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? C: Yeah , huge is a Yeah . A: Yep . A: Two . D: Two ? D: Alright . D: The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? A: Well , no . C: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s Yeah . A: We didn't implement anything about that . B: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . B: But We have so few functions , so Yeah . A: Well six then . D: Yeah . D: Six ? D: Right . C: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , but um um Yeah . A: Are the functions easy to learn ? A: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? D: Yeah , I agree . B: Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning . A: Yeah . A: Ah . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Alright . C: Mm ? D: Two ? A: Yeah , but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming . D: Yeah Yeah , I agree . C: Are we take too much time ? A: Uh not not towards you , but towards this all . D: No . A: Th this is We you have to put it to the customers . D: Yeah . D: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? D: R_S_I_ sensitive ? A: Uh well well a bit , so four . D: Four . D: Um Yeah . A: Yes . C: Yeah , very much . C: One . A: One . A: And features included also one . A: And One . A: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . A: Uh we still think so . C: Yeah . A: Device fancy feeling . C: And I think fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back . A: Yeah , cool man . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . D: Right . A: Are there enough technology ? A: Yeah well also we have two . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , that's great . A: Is the device easy to use ? B: The Two two . A: Yes we have not many buttons . C: So well maybe two because of the voice recorder . D: Well , with the uh Three . A: Two , three . B: T Yeah . A: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? C: F Yeah . A: Well in our covers , in our fronts . A: So yes , one . C: One or two . A: Is the material attractive ? B: One or two , another two . C: Yeah . D: Nah f four I think . C: Four ? D: If you look at this No . C: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . C: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . A: Oh okay . B: Well three . D: Three , alright . A: Okay . C: And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it . D: Yeah , that's true . A: Is the material attractive ? D: But Right . B: Mm . A: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . B: Yeah . A: So I would say at least two . A: Okay . A: Well Yeah . B: This is the last meeting ? A: Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . D: The average will uh come later . B: Yeah . C: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . A: Um Oh . C: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . A: Uh Yes . B: Yeah . A: Well , look at the costs at this point . C: My god . A: I had to fit it in . D: It has to go to twelve , right ? A: I twelve and a half . D: Twelve and a half . A: So Well what costs a lot ? A: The sample spea costs four . C: The what ? C: The Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . A: The sample speaker , the s sensor . D: Out . D: That's easy . D: Kick it out . A: Kick it out . B: The what ? D: Yeah . A: We have to go to twelve and a half . D: The speaker . A: The speaker costs far , by far the most . B: Oh . D: That's some wrong info , man . A: It it isn't worth it . C: No . D: No . C: No , d th No . A: We could make two different versions , one with and one without . D: It's uh It's just extra . A: But for this So , zero . D: Kick it out . C: Yeah . A: Then we go to fourteen point six . D: What more ? A: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . C: No . D: Batteries are uh quite Uh no , no no no . A: L_C_ three ? A: Yeah hand dynamo ? A: Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery . B: Um Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? C: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . C: Because uh the L_C_D_ screen . A: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . C: Yeah . B: Yeah ? D: Hmm . B: Can't we do that with a regular chip ? C: No . B: Why not ? C: Because uh that uh y because my information says it . A: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? C: Huh ? A: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? B: Yeah . B: Regular is normal . D: Yeah . A: And simple ? C: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but Yeah , I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . B: Simple . A: Nothing . B: Elementary . A: Well ? A: Your part . C: I d I didn't in include it in my report . A: What happens if we do How much do we win ? C: Single Well you have to use a chip . C: So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . B: We we we Why ? A: One . B: We have very little options furthermore , for the Uh well we have to put that in . C: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . A: Yeah . D: Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen . C: That that's a fact . A: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it . C: Uh Yeah , but it's only one half . D: No Yeah , but No , that's n It's not relevant . A: The special colour . B: Nah . C: Uh it d it doesn't But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . A: Yeah , then you s then you only have one half left . B: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . B: You must change the chip back , Nils . D: Yeah . A: Uh yeah . D: No , Then the whole concept is uh You You can make you can make it cheaper . C: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . C: I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . B: Hmm . B: No we oh You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an L_C_ display . C: You have to use it . D: But if you don't sell No no no no . A: Yeah . B: I think that's a bit double . A: Yeah ? B: Y we don't need both . A: No , the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . C: For the L_C_D_ screen . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: Says . A: Says , his Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . C: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? C: Because we you have uncurved Yeah . A: Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . B: I ? A: We can also make it flat . C: Well But what what did what do n Sorry , but What do they mean with the curves ? A: But Curved ? C: Is th Is this a curve ? A: Yes , that's curved . C: One curve ? C: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . A: Yes . C: It's how you It's how you look at it . A: No , it's one curve . B: One curve . A: One curve , simple . C: Well then we have a huge problem I think . C: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . A: We have a big financial problem . B: Well we make it more expensive to buy . A: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . A: Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh By the way , we also have this one . D: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . D: But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . C: But uh I Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . D: If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . B: Yeah or we could replace it Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , uh titanium-coloured plastic ? D: If you if you make it cool to have Oh , that's just great . A: Oh , costs nothing . D: Oh , alright . A: That's nice . A: Plastic is Yes , but I just got it . C: Well that's pretty uh l N not very practical . D: That is pretty stupid . C: Well But I'm n I don't agree . A: Who ? A: You want to dump the titanium ? B: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . A: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . B: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . C: I think I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that . A: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . B: Ah no no . B: It's not ugly looking . B: The looks remain the same . A: No , I don't think so . D: Y Yeah , I agree . B: Well , I do think so . A: Yes . A: And the feel , and th that it is strong , and We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one Why can't I I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . B: feel . C: And because i Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . C: Yeah . C: I think the titanium is very important . B: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there . C: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . C: W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . B: We can dump the special colour . B: We l we use plastic . B: And plastic is already in colour I think . D: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . C: Well what else ? C: W I mean uh Yeah . B: No , nothing . D: Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . B: Amen . D: But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . B: Yeah . D: Because you have lots of functions in it too . C: Yeah , well yeah . B: Yeah . C: Alright . C: I agree with that . B: But No no no no . C: So we u we use uh Unfortunately . C: Um . C: Titanium-coloured plastic . D: Yeah , I agree . C: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . A: I I'll talk to the managers . B: W Titanium stays there . A: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . C: Yeah this is good , but it it's not good enough . D: Osl If you don't have the money , you can't make it . A: But Ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? C: So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . B: Well No because we did not know anything about it . A: Come on . C: What do we Well what do we know ? A: Riot . C: All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . A: Yes , yes . C: So Yeah al alright , yeah . A: One and a half Euros . C: But we have to deal with it now . A: Hmm ? D: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . C: So So Titanium gone and add plastic . D: So this is too expensive . A: So ? D: So we have to make it cheaper . D: Right . B: Yeah , but then we've got money left . C: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? A: Well , no it's just uh all plastic . C: No No yeah well Oh six . A: Well alright . A: Huh . C: A lot of plastic , yeah . D: It's just free , man . A: Four . A: So But then we can add the special colour ? C: No two for the to make it clear . B: Yeah . A: As we have money over uh left . B: Yeah . A: And we still have money left . B: W Well I think uh the case is double curved then . A: What do we want , guys ? C: I want gold plating . C: No no um We have we have to uh fill W we ha No no no , but th that's not f um Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . D: Yeah right . D: I want chrome . A: Yes . B: Because you y have that curve and you have that curve . A: Y Oh no . B: Yeah well uh Well y we have curves in all directions . D: Well , th that that is the problem . A: Alright . A: Safe . C: And that we dropped , so it it can be done . A: So alright . C: But it's pretty funny . C: We we do want to reach twelve point five . C: But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . A: Finance ? B: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . C: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . A: Well , guys ? D: Yeah . A: Guys ? A: We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , project . D: Shoot . C: Objection . B: Pro project . A: Well , satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? C: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh I think it's uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . D: Yeah . A: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , me too . A: That's really bad . C: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but Which isn't very practical , but that's the way . A: But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , but also for our creativity . B: And uh unrealistic . A: We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . B: Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs . D: Right . A: Yeah . B: Nei . B: Uh no . A: Well , alright . C: Uh-huh . A: Uh leadership next . B: Terrible . A: Uh teamwork ? D: Leadership . B: Leadership ? D: Well it's It was very democratic . B: Well Yeah . A: Uh yeah well I think so also . B: Yeah . A: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so Well the managers were terrible . D: Yeah yeah . A: So , with their all their useless requirements . A: But o alright , the teamwork ? C: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . C: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . A: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . C: Yeah . C: Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . A: Alright , teamwork ? D: Well Yeah , think so too . A: Well great I think . B: Right yeah . A: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? C: It was a complete disaster . C: No Uh it it it uh it is uh No it's other way around . D: Yeah , I don't like it . A: Well It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . B: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . D: Yeah ? B: Or not ? C: That's the SMARTboard . C: That's the digital panel . A: I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one . D: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? A: Well it's both a SMARTboard . C: That's that's the smart A televi Yeah . D: Yeah right . D: B but you This is just a large t large television . B: Oh they're both SMARTboards . A: No . D: You u you use the Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . A: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . D: And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . A: Well , wi w which one did you like ? D: But That one . C: Yeah . C: Left or right ? B: Yeah . A: That one . D: That one isn't accurate . D: It just doesn't work . A: Yeah . D: You can Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard . B: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . A: Yes . A: Th that is so . C: Well I didn't use uh Nei It it's much m But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now . B: Yeah . A: We're now talking about the SMARTboards . B: Well we we used that one , and we needed it . D: Yeah , but give me a beamer . B: I think . D: That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . B: Yeah alright , but Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible . A: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it . D: Right . A: Okay , alright . C: Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , it is . C: The simple uh sch school board . A: So And uh the digi the digital pen ? D: I agree . A: Did uh did you like that one ? D: No . C: I I didn't use it . C: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop . A: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you're going to send it , yeah . D: Yeah . C: That's the W But also y you write things down . D: Yeah . D: It isn't practical . D: Right . A: Well , no . C: And i you can also bring your your your note block . D: Your notepad . C: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into Yeah alright . D: Yeah . A: It's , no , it it's useless . B: Well I I drew this . B: Mm . B: And I made a mistake . B: But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . A: Yes . A: For drawings , yes . C: For drawings , but not for personal notes . B: Yeah for drawings . C: I think that's not very Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've Yeah I understand . B: N notes mm . A: But But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . D: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . D: I I agree on that . B: Mm . A: And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . A: So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . D: Yeah , right . A: So it doesn't d doesn't have any Yep . D: That Stefan use . C: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . C: You can't It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah . D: No , I don't think so . D: It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . B: Yeah . B: But then uh it's really useful , I think . D: Yeah . A: Alright . C: Mu Yeah right . A: Um etcetera ? A: Well uh the laptops ? D: Yeah , great . A: Of course great . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Hmm . C: Can we keep them ? A: Yeah . C: Uh . A: You can . A: B by my Yeah . D: Wireless uh wireless things . B: Thanks Project Manager . A: Other uh things we used here ? A: I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . D: Well these chairs , man . A: But No No . C: Well did you really uh Did you really take uh take those in account ? D: Really great . C: I half of time I didn't notice they were there . A: No . A: I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . C: So But we shouldn't talk about that . A: I don't care about it . B: Well I did . C: Because this is a realistic environment . A: Well w why not ? A: Uh etcetera We N new ideas found ? C: Right . C: Okay . A: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What ? A: For future um meetings you have got ? B: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , yeah . D: Communicate in between . B: Email or chat or something . D: Yeah , right . A: Chatting and emailing . C: But yeah . C: W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . D: Yeah . C: So Well , for drawing for drawings . B: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . D: Yeah , I agree . A: Well , new ideas found by this . A: Not . A: Nothing . D: Well , more more information in the beginning . A: We don't want this . A: We hate this . B: Yeah . D: That's For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . A: Digital pen is useless . B: No it isn't . A: So Yeah , for drawings . B: Yeah . C: Yeah . B: So it isn't useless . A: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . C: Well No But it's still an expensive uh expensive But if w Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper . D: Well Yeah , I agree . B: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . B: With the mouse it is No . A: Yeah . C: Well and if And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . D: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . B: Uh indeed . C: But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? A: Well no . A: I hated to draw like that . C: A Really ? A: You you can't draw anything uh neat . D: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , yeah , very precise Yeah , mu It saves time . C: Anything you want . C: Any b b Yeah . A: I if it if it would be perfect following . C: L li li Yeah . A: Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board . C: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . B: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh Hmm . C: Yeah . A: Yep . C: I it has It is useful . C: Yeah . A: Yeah yeah . C: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . C: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work , I think then it's pretty useful . A: Yep . A: Yeah . C: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . C: And then you can save it immediately . A: Well , they are now . D: Celebration . A: It is . A: So , congratulations crew . C: Did you type that ? B: Hmm . B: Celebration . A: Se Finally my beer . D: Well Yeah . B: Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money . A: Well , that's it I think . B: Yeah . A: Um I don't know how long we still have . A: I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . A: But uh Well yeah , it is a bit uh Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . C: Maybe till four o'clock or something ? C: Well dunno . C: Yeah . A: I have to do that . D: You better get started . A: I Di did you um save this one in the folder ? B: Oh . B: No . A: Can you do that ? B: No no no no . C: No we must save this thing , yeah . C: In the shared map map . B: But Nils you've got some work left . A: I don't know what you have to do . C: Map , is it a good word ? C: The folder , yeah . D: Huh . B: I have to go to a physiotherapy . A: Yeah . A: Oh it worked . A: Two times quick . B: Wow . D: Oh , alright . A: Cool . C: So it is useful , yeah . B: Yeah . B: It is handy . D: Oh great , man . C: No but uh Radical . D: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom . A: This is nice . A: Uh D design . C: Yeah . C: Do you believe it yourself ? A: S Oh . A: He saved them all ten . A: Well alright . A: Um Yeah . B: Well they they wanted everything we produced , so My big bird . C: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh Your big beautiful bird . A: Well Where is this ? C: Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't . C: Of or the other way around uh Yeah I think so too . D: Maybe you are broken . D: You know . B: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . D: I think she's listening . A: I also think so . A: She already knows . C: Who is she you're talking about ? C: Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach . A: She ? A: Big brother . A: Our manager . C: Is she also our accountant ? C: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? A: Yeah . A: I don't think so . C: Oh . B: Close your laptop . C: Because then we have to confront her with our Yeah . B: So she can see we're ready . D: I feel watched . A: Alright . B: Yeah . A: We put the fashion in electronics , but we couldn't because of the costs . B: Let's take this remote into uh production . A: That that's the title of our uh end document . C: That that's our new slogan . D: Yeah . C: Yeah , I like that . A: We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics . C: Blame our accountants . D: Do that . A: Yeah , that's a nice title . D: Yeah . C: But we couldn't , yeah . D: Very catching . A: Oh . C: Well I th Yeah . D: I'm sure management would like that . B: She's on the move . D: Oh , that's just great .","summary":"The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. After the presentation, the product was evaluated. This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design. Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings). *NA* Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype. The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros. They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason. There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle). The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top. The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros. The team had to discuss which features should be discarded. The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design. Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote. The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10. The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings. Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off their fourth meeting, the team gathered to finalize decisions on their remote control prototype. The participants, including A, B, C, and D, discussed various aspects of the design, such as the use of titanium, different colors, and button layouts. They evaluated the costs meticulously, aiming to reach a target price of \u20ac12.50 per unit. Despite facing financial constraints, they decided to replace the expensive titanium with titanium-colored plastic to meet the budget. The team also debated the usefulness of tools like the SMARTboard and digital pen, with mixed opinions on their practicality. They agreed to save their work in a shared folder for future reference. As they wrapped up, they coined a new slogan, \"Putting the Fashion in Electronics,\" reflecting their innovative approach. Despite challenges and differing views, they celebrated their progress and readiness to move the project forward, demonstrating a blend of creativity, practicality, and financial acumen in their decision-making process.","relevance":0.3904310465,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the team's target price for the remote control prototype?","answer":"The team aimed to reach a target price of \u20ac12.50 per unit."},{"question":"What material did the team decide to replace with titanium to meet the budget?","answer":"The team decided to replace the expensive titanium with titanium-colored plastic."},{"question":"What slogan did the team coin to reflect their innovative approach?","answer":"The team coined the slogan 'Putting the Fashion in Electronics.'"},{"question":"What tools did the team debate the usefulness of during the meeting?","answer":"The team debated the usefulness of the SMARTboard and digital pen, with mixed opinions on their practicality."}]}

D: Yeah . A: Okay next one . B: Okay . B: Let's try this . C: Whoo . B: Uh Um . D: Yeah , yeah . B: Mm-hmm . B: Mm . C: Oh not . C: Oh . A: Oh . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Yeah . C: No problem . C: Shit happens . D: I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . D: Okay . C: A parrot . D: Wow . C: Ish . D: Oh . C: He did it before . B: Uh No , no . B: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Nice . C: Oh . A: Very good . B: Uh blank . C: Thank you . A: Okay . A: Very good . A: So um you can always go back . A: So That's it . A: So that was two . A: Now next . A: The budget . A: The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . A: And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . A: So now we have to think about what we will make . A: First I wanna hear from you . A: Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . A: So F first . C: Uh I will start . C: Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . C: Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . C: So that won't be uh our goal , I think . B: No . C: And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think . C: Not all the small buttons , you don't know Big buttons , positive . A: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? A: Positive . C: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . A: Okay . A: What are your experiences ? B: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . B: And that it controls the channels and the the volume . A: Mm . B: And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . B: So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . B: And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . B: And uh yeah . B: Uh Yeah , but No no no . A: So and do they always have that ? B: But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . A: It's easy to you . B: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Yeah . A: Kay . D: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . D: We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . C: Thank you . D: That's not really ea easy . C: Help also . D: So it would be nice if we have one for all . C: Thank you . D: And we also had a remote control for our radio set . D: But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . D: And it was uh uh v not easy to use . D: So we n barely used it . A: Okay so they have too much . A: So next . B: Hmm . A: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . A: So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? A: What what does it have to have ? C: The weight . C: Not not too heavy . A: Not too heavy . C: Not much buttons . A: Yes . A: Yeah . C: Bust-free . C: That when you drop it , it won't break . C: Like uh some kind of rubber on it . C: Or hard uh hard plastic . C: Uh buttons not too small . C: Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . A: Yes . C: Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . C: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . A: Like a phone . C: And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . D: Yeah . A: Okay . B: Yeah . A: So , that's . C: Next . B: Yeah well that's that are good ideas . B: Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . B: If you push a button . B: Um Yeah . B: And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . B: So probably plastic or something . B: Uh Mm no . A: Okay . D: Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . D: Or you won't sell it . A: Yes . D: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . D: And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . A: Okay . A: This is It has to be compatible with other things . D: Yes . A: Okay . C: I have one more idea . C: Just popped up . A: Yes ? C: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . C: So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . A: No battery use . A: So more ideas ? A: No okay . A: It's only the first ideas . A: So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . A: Uh Okay . A: Next meeting , half an hour . A: Um , what you have to do . A: Well look on your . A: And Next instructions you'll get in your email . A: So This is the first meeting . A: See you later in half an hour . B: Yes . C: Okay . D: Okay . C: Thank you .","summary":"For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the project, the team gathered for their first meeting to brainstorm ideas for a new remote control design. Participants included A, the facilitator, B with insights on remote control functionality, C emphasizing user-friendliness, and D focusing on marketability. They discussed the need for an original, trendy, and durable design within a budget constraint of \u20ac12.50 per unit, aiming for a selling price of \u20ac25. Ideas ranged from lightweight construction to fewer buttons, drop-resistance, and battery efficiency. Decision-wise, they agreed to focus on a design with big, user-friendly buttons, a visible LED indicator, and cross-device compatibility. Action items included creating functional, conceptual, and detailed designs for the remote control, with deadlines set for document saving after each stage. The next meeting was scheduled in half an hour for further instructions via email, marking the end of their productive initial session.

A: So Yeah on your computer , or the What's the name ? C: Okay . C: Uh I've Where have I put it ? C: My Documents or not ? C: Hmm . C: I've save it on my computer , my presentation . C: But where ? C: Uh uh uh It was about the working of the remote control . A: What's the name of it ? A: It's the technical function or the functional requirements . C: Nope . C: Not a of Wait . C: The working design . C: But I've saved it . A: Working design . C: But now I don't know where it is . C: Hmm . A: Working design . A: What is this ? A: Product documents . C: Yeah .

A: Save as . A: Uh it's Project . D: Desktop . C: Project . D: Yeah . A: Save . C: Okay . D: Okay . A: Very good . D: Well . C: A little later but here it is . A: Okay . A: So Now have ten minutes to tell it . C: So okay . C: It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . C: It's about the working of the remote control . C: I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it . D: Make it . C: Ten minutes to tell it . C: Okay . C: I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . A: Okay . C: The working bout it uh of it . C: Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . C: With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes . C: And then uh what I'll think about it . C: First , the findings . C: The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . C: Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , um because its uh not so expensive . C: And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . C: There's a lot of small uh electronics . C: So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . C: Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . C: Now And here I have the top of the remote control . C: Uh here's some kind of chip . C: Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . C: Uh you have all on your remote control . C: And uh the teletext uh button . C: And uh here's the battery . C: And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . C: And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . C: That's what I said , it's very difficult . C: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . C: And that will send it to your television . C: That's a short h uh how it works . C: Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all we all don't get it . C: My preferences ? C: It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big . C: Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . C: A long-lasting battery . C: Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . C: Not other materials . C: Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . C: We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . C: And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . C: And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . C: That's I think it's easier . B: Mm-hmm . C: And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . C: Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . C: Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . C: And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . C: This is uh just uh Yeah . A: Oh oh . A: Two questions . C: Yeah . A: The battery . A: You say one battery is cheaper . A: Why ? C: If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . A: Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . C: Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . A: Okay so it's the size of the remote control . C: Just Yeah . A: Okay and the buttons . A: When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it . C: Yeah . C: But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? A: S Okay . C: Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ? A: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . C: Then this is an option . A: So Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though . C: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . C: And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . C: And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the Yeah ? A: We have to choose one . A: It has to work on o uh all televisions . B: Mm . C: Okay . C: Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . C: And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . D: Hmm . A: Okay . C: And I just uh have one more idea . C: Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . C: But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . C: To change covers . C: So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . C: And then you can put a red cover on it . D: Hmm . C: And also different things . A: Yeah . A: Good idea . D: Will this will this add to the cost ? C: Yes . C: Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . C: And then you can buy the covers . D: Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D: D does it make it more difficult to design ? C: I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . A: Mm-hmm . D: Not much . D: Kay . C: Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . A: Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . C: Just one . C: Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . C: If it won't works then we'll get something else . C: Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . A: Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? C: Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . A: Yeah but there are also design cost . A: I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? C: Maybe . A: Would you change the cover ? C: I wi I won't . C: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . A: No . A: N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit . C: Uh Yeah . A: So Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . C: Okay . C: And the other people ? D: Um Mm . C: What do you think about it ? B: Yeah it's a good idea . B: But If if it Yeah , I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . C: Okay . B: No . C: Okay . C: You're the Project Manager . A: Okay . C: Yes . C: That's it . A: That's clear . A: Okay thank you . A: So now the User Interface Designer . B: Oh . B: That's me . B: Uh Come on . B: Ah . D: Yeah . B: Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . B: Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . B: Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . B: No cords attached . B: And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . B: That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . B: Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . B: Uh well the same idea here . B: Uh message to the television . B: And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that . B: Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . B: Uh We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . B: But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . B: Or uh uh more functions on the remote . B: Uh maybe more devices you can influence . B: Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . B: Yeah well that's our dilemma . B: Um any ideas about that ? B: Basic or multifunctional ? A: We'll got back on that later . B: Okay yeah . B: Yeah well the that was just on my mind . D: Yes . B: So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . B: Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk . C: Kay . A: Kay , thank you . A: Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . D: Okay . D: Uh um m Yeah . D: Um yeah okay . D: This bit too far . D: So So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . D: Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . D: And we looked at uh several um things . D: Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . D: Uh well what what will be our market . D: And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . D: If um that would be a good idea or not . D: Well our findings . D: Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . D: Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . D: And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . D: Uh well they also zap a lot . D: So uh zapping uh should be very easy . D: And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . D: So a lot of unused buttons . D: There is more findings . D: Uh on the buttons . D: Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? D: And how much would they use them ? D: Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . D: And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . D: The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . D: Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . D: Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . D: Uh the screen and the brightness . D: And uh channel settings . D: Uh th and they also are not used very often . D: Then we have a few um graphs about the market . D: Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . D: Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . D: Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . D: And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it . D: But uh they are not a very big group . D: Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . D: If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . D: Now you can clearly see young users say . D: I will that would very nice . D: And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . D: And they won't like it . D: And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . D: Well here we see the same . D: Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . D: And old users not . D: Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . D: Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . D: Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . D: And um they are more critical on their money spending . D: Uh the second group is the older group . D: Aged between forty six and sixty five . D: They are less interested in uh new features . D: But uh they spend their money more easily . D: Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . D: And the second group about forty percent . D: So the the first group is bigger . D: Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . D: Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . D: Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . D: But less of them will buy it . D: Um well I uh Okay . D: What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . D: So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . D: And um we can make special features . D: But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . D: But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . B: Mm-hmm . D: Um well th uh that's my second point . D: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . D: It's about discussion we had earlier . D: Um You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . D: So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . D: And such things . D: Um well the design is very important . D: One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . D: But they found most remote controls very ugly . D: So the design of our remote control is very important . D: And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . D: That were my findings . A: Okay thank you . C: Yeah . C: I have uh one question . C: If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . A: Yes . D: Yes . B: Mm-hmm . C: Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . B: No . C: Do you think ? D: No . B: And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . C: Like No . C: No . B: So it's Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . C: Uh-huh . A: I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . A: So I think that can be an d good option . B: Mm-hmm . A: L_C_D_ . B: Just the L_C_D_ ? A: Yes . A: Only the L_C_D_ . B: Mm-hmm . A: So But we'll come back on that . D: Okay . A: Now Oh , go on . A: What d d d um Um Uh we go back on the decisions later . A: Now we have a few new product requirements . A: First , teletext . A: We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . A: So not necessary . A: Next . A: Only for the television . A: So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . A: Only the television . A: Third . A: We look at the age group of forty plus . A: Uh no , younger than forty . A: Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . A: Fourth point . A: Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . A: Very important for the design . A: So you can see it on our site . A: Next . A: Um no . A: We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . A: So like you said , we need the . A: Maybe it's good to put it in a document . A: Now we have to decide what controls do we need . A: So maybe you can tell us . D: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . A: Sorry ? D: The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . A: Yes . A: Yes , it's okay . D: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . D: Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . A: Yeah but we don't use it . A: It's a new requirement . A: So , it's not my requirement . C: Kay , we'll just have to do that . A: We have to do this . C: Okay . D: Okay . C: No discussion about it . D: Okay sorry . D: Then uh Mine ? A: No . C: Okay . C: Unfortunately . A: So what controls do we need ? A: Who first ? B: Well a power button ? A: Okay . A: Uh power . B: Uh the well um I think separate channels . B: So But then both the the separate channels . A: Uh mm channel . B: So so uh zero to nine or something . A: Channel Zero to nine . B: Uh volume . A: Volume . A: Maybe it's easy to pick . A: What was w your one ? A: Techno Okay . D: It's the functional requirements . A: We had w uh no no no no . A: Where was that example of the Johan . B: Oh mine . A: That was the the the the the technical Hallo . B: Technical . A: Okay . A: What do we need ? A: On-off . A: Zero to nine . C: To change to the next channel , just one button . C: To move up , move down . A: Yeah that's the channel . D: D Yeah . D: Do we make a menu ? A: Menu ? A: Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . A: Uh M Menu . D: Uh I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . A: I think um the only one or two numbers . B: Mm yes . A: And Hello ? A: That's ch Yes . D: Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . D: And uh a menu uh button . D: And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . D: But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . A: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? D: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . D: Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . A: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . A: So we need N Yes . D: Yes . C: But then we come to the costs . A: But if we have this So now we don't have a lot of buttons . D: Kay . D: But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . D: And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . D: So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . A: Is this enough ? B: Mute . A: Mute . A: Maybe in the menu ? B: Um Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do . D: Mm . A: Mute . A: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Maybe more ? A: No . A: Well . A: Then that's all . A: This will be the buttons . A: And I think that's enough for the next phase . A: So we can go on to Yes . C: But now we have only the buttons . C: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? C: Or Okay . A: No that's for the next phase . A: Um Phase two is the conceptual design . A: So then we'll have the concepts . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: That's for the So uh next point . A: Now we have lunch-break . A: After that we have t thirty minutes for work . A: And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . A: No . A: Your individual action , you can find them in the email . A: So now it's time for lunch . C: Okay . D: Okay . D: Good idea . A: Thanks for coming .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material. He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this. The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional. The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study. The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them. The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed. The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute. The design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting. Individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent. The buttons will consist of number, a menu button, arrows for changing channel and volume, but also navigating the menu, and a mute button. *NA*","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the secretary outlined the agenda, starting with updates from the Industrial Designer, who struggled to locate his presentation on remote control workings. Despite the initial hiccup, the presentation delved into the intricate details of the remote control's design, highlighting cost considerations at \u20ac12.50 per unit. The discussion then shifted to the User Interface Designer, who pondered the dilemma of creating a basic versus multifunctional remote control, considering financial constraints. The Marketing Expert presented findings from a usability lab-test, emphasizing the importance of a user-friendly design and the target market segments, with a focus on the younger demographic. Decisions were made to exclude teletext, target the younger age group, and incorporate the corporate color and slogan. The team brainstormed essential controls like power, channel selection, volume, and a menu button, considering the balance between functionality and cost. As the meeting concluded, plans were set for the next phase of conceptual design, with action-items assigned for further exploration of the remote control's appearance and features.

{"meeting_id":"TS3010c","dialogue":"A: Okay . A: Well , let's start . A: What are we doing ? A: Oops . B: Hmm . C: Ah , pinball . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Not doing . D: Mm . A: Uh Very good . D: Ah . B: Oh . D: Hey . D: Ah . D: Now I have my screen back too . A: Okay . D: Yeah . A: we have presentations . A: So first , it's your turn . B: Mine . B: Oh , great . A: Yeah . C: Huh . A: Isn't it amazing . D: Yeah . D: Very interesting . B: Uh Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . A: Industrial Designer . A: Interface concept . B: Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . B: And uh my personal preferences . B: Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . B: The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . B: The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . B: Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . B: And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . B: Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . B: Examples . B: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Yeah . D: Large . D: A lot a lot of buttons buttons . B: Yeah . B: Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . B: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . B: Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . B: Like there . B: And uh Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . B: And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . B: Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . B: But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . B: Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . B: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . D: Yeah . B: Um Yeah . B: So , that's Uh , well Yeah . A: Can you go back one page ? A: For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? A: We don't have buttons for the menu . A: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . B: I thought that was our uh idea . A: Okay . B: So , uh how Like this . A: But uh You have to put it on the Yeah . B: Or or this . B: And that the menu button is okay . A: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . B: Yeah , okay . D: Yes . B: Uh , so the The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yes . A: The second one . B: Yeah . B: Uh , well that's something to uh think about . A: Okay . C: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . C: And you will see it . B: Okay . D: Okay . B: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . B: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . B: Uh , round edges . B: The logo at the bottom . B: And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . B: So , it's good . B: Uh , recognisable . B: K so , I think . A: Not too much colours . B: Uh , no . B: Not too much . B: But uh No , no , no . A: No , it's not flower power . B: But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . A: S okay . A: Okay . B: That was that . A: Thank you . A: So , you're next . C: I'm next , okay . C: Yes . C: No . C: Here we go . C: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . D: Okay . D: Mm-hmm . C: And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . C: First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . C: Like , totally yellow , totally red . C: Uh , so it's visible . C: Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . C: Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . C: But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . C: But that's just an idea . C: And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . C: The battery , there are few options . C: Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . C: So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . C: Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . C: When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . C: Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved . C: And maybe like it's hand-shaped . C: Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . C: Uh material , you use plastic . C: Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . C: And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . C: Uh the push-buttons . C: We have one new thing uh discovered . C: It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . C: Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . C: When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . C: And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . C: Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . C: And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . C: You can do it with your thumb . C: And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one . D: Hmm . C: The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . C: There are also uh simple chips . C: They are uh cheaper . C: Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . C: They have seen enough of it . C: And you have also advanced um chips . C: But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . C: And the costs will increase a lot more . C: And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . C: And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . C: Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . C: You have any more questions about this ? C: I think the main thing is we look at the costs . D: Yep . A: Hmm . C: And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . D: Yeah . D: But , thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_ ? D: No , not . C: Not with an L_C_D_ . A: No , isn't . C: No . A: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . A: Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . C: Yeah . C: But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . A: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . C: Th then you'll see it on the television . A: If you don't Hmm , yes . A: But then . A: Yeah , then you go one down one up . A: When you scroll . C: Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . A: Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . A: So you may not be uh No . A: The television must do that . C: Mm-hmm . A: So Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . C: Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . A: And mostly they are smaller . C: Yes . A: So Most the times that are not advanced televisions . C: But that won't be a problem . C: I think . C: No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . C: And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . C: And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . C: Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . C: And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . A: Okay . D: Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? C: I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . C: But I don't know uh how much higher . D: Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . A: That's important . C: That's true . D: And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh . C: But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . C: If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . C: With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . C: And then a flat um remote control . C: Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . A: Yeah . A: Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . C: I can uh look on my uh Uh Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A: It's very important . C: A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . C: The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . A: Yeah , more expensive . A: But how much ? C: Doesn't say . A: Oh . B: Hmm . A: Okay . C: That's from my manufacturing division . A: Okay . D: Kay . A: Well , thank you . D: My turn ? C: Yes ? A: Next . D: Mm . D: So So Yeah . D: So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . D: Uh , I did some trend-watching . D: It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . D: Cause if you don't , you won't sell . D: So , well how we did do that ? D: Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . D: They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . D: Of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends . D: And well , uh what did you find ? D: Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . D: Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . D: And um , material ? D: That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . D: And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . D: Then the old and rich . D: They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . D: And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . D: Now , another picture . D: To get a feeling for this . D: Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . D: We uh aim at the younger market . D: So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . D: However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . D: It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different . D: And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . D: So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . D: So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind . C: Changing covers . D: Yeah . D: Any questions ? C: Nope . B: No . A: No . A: It's clear . A: So now , it's uh Ah , let's see . A: Now , w we have to decide Well , we have to decide on the concept . A: So , we have to look at 'S next . A: Components and user interface concept . A: So Now , we have to make some concept . A: Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . A: First , uh user interface . C: Uh , uh-uh . C: How w how we how we make it ? C: Uh Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all Yeah , but if I paint with More like something M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . A: Yes , a concept on uh Just Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . D: Yeah . A: Uh , what do we want ? A: I'll paint . A: Okay . A: Well Something like this ? D: Mm . A: Or Shapes or What do we need ? B: Mm , yes . D: Can make several uh concepts . B: What ? A: Yes , okay . D: We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . A: Okay . D: Yeah I I I uh yes . C: Uh I have to . A: And you have to . A: Yeah . C: I'm not a designer . C: It's more three D_ . C: Like , um when you have a part here . C: This is the remote control . C: And then you have something like th this under it . C: So , it's easier to get it like this . B: Mm . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: It's like a gun . D: A g Mm . A: So , it has to be soft ? C: And it has to be soft , yeah . A: Okay . C: So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? A: And uh , the buttons ? A: Buttons . C: Buttons on top of it . C: And here . C: The scrolling . C: You can do it with your thumb . B: But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? C: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . A: No , it won't . C: One till uh uh zero till nine . A: But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . B: Yeah , okay . B: But but how Yeah . D: Yeah . C: And the b Yeah ? B: How Okay . C: Or two buttons . D: And i if we go to uh But if we have uh a me Yeah . A: Uh , two scroll uh wheels . C: If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu uh button . B: Mm . A: That's th that's more difficult . A: It's better in But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . D: If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? C: And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . C: Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . D: Yeah . C: Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it . B: Yeah . C: Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . D: Uh-uh . A: Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? A: You don't know . A: So , there's no menu . C: I don't know . C: It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . A: No . A: So you can't use it . C: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . A: Okay , we make two concepts . A: One with L_C_D_ . A: One without L_C_D_ . C: Kay . C: But you all like this kind of thing . C: Uh With the scroll button . A: Good concept . A: But That's one . C: And and this one has to be soft . D: Uh-uh . C: And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . C: Or some kind of rubber around it . B: Mm-hmm . A: It's one . A: Two . A: Number two . B: And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . B: Like uh Just to uh Oh , like a Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Ah that's nice . C: Here . C: Trigger . A: No . A: But when you handle it , you put it on and off . A: It's not good to use . A: Yeah , but I'll zap . A: Fuck . A: Out . A: No , it's not good . D: Yeah . A: Now , second concept . A: One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . A: Then uh Paint it . C: Paint it ? C: With the scroll thing on , like this ? A: One with two scroll buttons and one with without . A: Yeah . A: Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . C: So ? A: And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . C: Draw it . A: Unbelievable . A: Do I have to do everything . A: Blank . A: You have Not so difficult . B: But if you put push the the menu button Yeah , wh what Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . D: Yeah . A: Uh , that's the menu . A: There for the L_C_D_ screen . A: You have to For the menu . B: Yeah . A: Mm-hmm . A: One that way . A: And one that way . A: So Then it depends on the cost . A: S On and off . C: But is it easy to use ? C: When you have it on your left side , and Separate , more separate , h yeah . A: When it's not too big . A: Just like a a phone . B: Mm-hmm . D: M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . A: Yes , okay . D: Like , you have the menu button in between uh Yeah . C: Yeah . C: On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . C: But would it be easy to use then ? C: If it's like you have a big uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . A: Very good . A: Is it better ? A: When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there . C: They were like round curves , uh different uh Okay , okay , okay . A: Yeah , okay . A: That's that's the outside . A: But now the First the buttons . C: Mm-hmm . D: Think we have we have now two buttons missing . D: The uh um The mute button . A: Sorry ? D: We have two buttons missing . D: The mute button . D: And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay . A: Mute . A: And the other . A: Yeah . A: Not so difficult . D: But , uh Okay . C: Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . A: But how do you wanna solve it ? C: With the switch button . A: Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . A: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . C: No like uh Oh , you mean like that . A: Yeah . C: Uh , then you can also have like uh th um Yeah , and joystick , I think . A: A joystick . A: Yeah . A: But is it uh Does that break , a joystick ? A: Or a small one just like in a laptop . C: Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . C: A little bit bigger , with easier thi I don't know . A: Mean , it's better . A: But how expensive it is ? A: Oh . A: Why do I pay you for ? A: Um , well um Better ideas . C: Or no scroll uh things . C: Just a shape . C: And No , no . A: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . C: It won't work . C: Yeah . C: Uh-huh . A: So Think we have to keep them . C: Or a remote control more like joystick . A: Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better . A: A small one . C: A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k Playstation thing . A: No just like in a a laptop . A: Small , round . A: Then it's not so big . C: No , no , no . C: I mean the the shape of the remote control . A: Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand . C: Just like a Playstation thing . C: Yeah . A: So Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A: A small one . A: So , please look at it . C: No , that's okay , I got Uh they're not uh in details . D: And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? D: Uh , it costs extra ? C: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? A: Yeah we I think you get it . A: So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . C: Then I have to come with it . A: Yes . C: I got my personal costs . C: I I don't I don't know the costs . A: Your problem . A: Not mine . C: Then I'll uh make something up . A: Okay . A: So , do we have other concepts ? A: Then for the components , we use a normal battery . B: Mm , yeah . A: Then it's Ch cheapest way , I think . C: Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . A: No , no kinetic . C: Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . A: Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . C: Yeah . A: So we use a normal battery . D: Yeah . B: Yeah . C: Okay . D: Yes . A: Chip . A: Depends on the L_C_D_ . C: Depends on the scroll . A: Scroll . C: If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . C: If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . C: And that's Uh the most expensive . A: Yeah . A: And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Yes , okay . C: Yeah . A: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . C: If we Yeah . A: Okay . C: If we No okay scroll-wheel . C: So , I have this . C: So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . A: Okay . A: So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But , it has to be small . A: I think .

C: Just use your thumb . C: If you Yeah . C: I use my thumb . A: k Yeah , but but then you have it . A: Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . C: Yeah . A: And the screen is Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . C: If you have a joystick on No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . A: Yeah . C: And you move up , f forward , down , left . C: Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . C: It's not just uh straight . A: No . A: No , no . C: That's how we use it . D: Uh Uh , yeah , but Yeah . C: That's why they make joysticks like that , I think . A: Yeah , but then you look forward . A: And then you can y N well , if you have to look at it . C: Yeah ? D: If you If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ . C: Kay . C: Here's our designer . C: Yeah . A: Then it goes like this . C: Yeah , why not . A: If th n well Yes , of course . C: It's for the younger people . C: It's something new . B: It's uh Or you can uh turn it inside . A: That's good good . A: But the um , it may not break . C: Now we put uh rubber around it . A: Okay . A: If that's possible . D: Um , Yeah . C: Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . C: And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . A: Okay . D: I can't see the . D: But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it . B: But that's No , that's true . C: Huh . D: Uh , for us it's about to sell it . D: Uh One . A: Yeah of course . C: This is something new . A: Okay . A: Then this is the design . A: And the buttons are on the next page . A: So , depends on the cost . A: So , um we have one minute . C: Costs are okay . A: I think . D: No . A: No . D: You have more . A: More . A: Seven . D: You have still ten . A: Next meeting . A: Thirty minutes . A: So hurry up . C: Oh , that's us together . A: You two stay here . A: Paint it . B: Okay . A: Now you have to . A: So I think it's clear . A: Check your mail . A: So It has to be ready in the next meeting . D: Yeah . C: Yes . A: So Next meeting is called the detailed design . D: What ? B: Cookie . D: Okay . A: So Everyth everything has to be ready . D: Okay . A: Thanks for your attention . C: Kay . D: See you at the next meeting . C: Bye bye .","summary":"The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls. He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons. The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber. He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used. The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision. The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products. The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board. They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs. The interface designer will find out how much an LCD screen will cost. The industrial designer and user interface designer will stay in the room to design the prototypes. The remote will use a normal battery. The case will be made of hard plastic and rubber. Whether to use an LCD screen or not. There was a lack of information about the cost of an LCD screen. If they can use a menu on the TV screen if the remote does not have an LCD. Whether to have a trigger-shaped power button. Whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to discuss the design concepts for a new remote control targeted at both young and trendy individuals as well as the older, affluent demographic.

A: We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . D: Alright . A: So , I'm gonna look . D: Do we Do we change the Do we change the the order ? A: We have Sorry ? D: Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? A: Finance is um Yeah it's No , first uh Yes . A: We have to evaluate the product yet . D: Okay . A: Sorry . D: That's uh um That can be none . D: Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . D: But I have uh a introduction how it works . D: So , it will come up . D: Uh-oh . D: Okay . D: Um , yeah . D: Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . D: Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . D: To false , seven ? D: And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . D: We can uh Well , it look like this . D: But we gonna uh do it here , they said . D: So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . D: Yeah . D: Okay , yeah . D: Yeah . D: Um , well uh we have the Word document You So we open up that blank here . A: Criteria . D: Um Think I can Uh , what this just an example . D: So , this not very important . D: But um , if I can get a number in here . D: Hmm . A: No , it's okay . D: Well , uh we can't do that . C: I'll get it . A: Oh , it's okay . D: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . D: Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . D: And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . D: The first uh on each item . A: What do you think ? D: Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . D: Only the L_C_D_ . D: So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . D: Hmm . C: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . C: What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . C: I think technologically I'll give it an seven . C: Si six six . C: Sorry , six . D: So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . A: Yeah . D: And you true or false . C: Oh , true or false . C: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . D: And true is one . D: So , yeah . D: Yeah . A: Two . C: Sorry . A: You ? B: Three . A: Me too . A: So it's a three . D: Kay . D: Um , well It's a one . D: The first item . D: So , okay the second item . D: Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . B: Mm Mm , four . D: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . D: It doesn't look like that . A: So it's a Yes , it's for the younger g group . D: That's uh a six . C: Five . B: Yeah , but it's it's Yeah . A: So it's uh half half of the people . A: So I think it's four . B: I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . B: So I mean , the colours are for young people , but older Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: No . A: Yes . A: So , I think it's four . C: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours . B: Yeah . B: Maybe . A: Okay . A: Give it a four . C: Four . D: Four . A: Yep . D: Uh , okay . D: Mm . A: We put the fashion in electronics . D: That's uh the motto of our company . D: Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? D: I um Yeah . D: I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . D: Um , so I would give it a two . C: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . C: But the rest of it is . C: So , I think a two . B: Yes . B: Two . D: Two . A: Uh , I say uh a five . A: It's not fashion , it's new . A: It must be a fashion . A: But it isn't . C: It it will be fashion . A: Yes . A: It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . A: So , it must be a fashion . A: I think it's a five . D: Uh Okay . B: Then make it th three . D: Okay . D: Yes , I'll think of that too . A: No . C: Kay . A: Oh . C: Three is okay . D: Yeah , agree ? A: I use my feet though . C: Oh , we'll wait outside . D: A three . A: Okay . D: Yeah okay . D: The next element um is the product looks good . D: Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . D: So , I would give this a five . C: I give it a one . B: Yes , a one . B: I like it . A: Well , I say three . A: So , counting then is two and a half . D: We have to do our uh Two or three ? C: Say two . A: Okay , two . C: Two . D: Two . D: Okay . D: So , well we gonna do the next part . D: Uh , yep . D: Uh uh , the next statement . D: It has not too much buttons . D: Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . D: And in the end we calculate an average . D: So , um that's why it's a negative in it . D: Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . D: So , um uh did we uh do that ? D: Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . D: But you can you can go for that . D: And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . D: So , I would give this a two . C: One . A: You ? B: One . A: Me too . A: One . D: One . D: Um , but where where is the ? A: Next , six . A: It does not get lost easily . D: So Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? C: Uh Just a small thing . B: Yes . A: No , we did not . B: Yeah , but uh Yeah . A: So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? C: Ah . A: I don't think so . C: Yellow . C: Looks like a pistol . A: Yes . A: Not a not a normal shapes . C: Uh It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . A: So No . A: It won't get lost . D: Yeah . A: So A one ? C: Uh Yeah , o one . D: It won't . B: Yeah . A: Okay , a one . D: One . A: Next . D: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . D: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . D: I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . A: Yeah me That was our target . C: Yeah . C: Me too . A: Two . C: Two . D: Yeah . C: Yeah ? A: Yep . C: Yeah . A: Right . A: There's a fancy look-and-feel . D: Uh , yes . D: That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . D: I didn't uh say it in my presentation . D: But um , well does it have that ? D: I would say yes . D: So um Well , let's also give this a two . D: T Yeah . C: I gave this a one because of the rubber . C: It feels soft . C: Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . C: It's Yeah . C: Yeah , f very fancy trendy . A: Okay . B: Yes , a one . A: I say a two . A: It's a a bit personal . A: If it's fancy . A: So I think s two is better . B: Yeah , okay . D: Okay . C: Two is okay . D: Two . D: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . A: No , it's new . A: Innovation . D: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . C: Oh . D: So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . D: I We'll go for a three . C: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . C: Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . D: Yes . C: Uh But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . C: Something what also younger people want . C: It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . A: Okay . B: Mm , three . A: Me too . A: Three . D: A three . A: Yeah . D: Okay . D: So um , come back to the presentation now . D: So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . D: So , we will do that . A: Effort is three , ten and twelve . D: Yes . A: Thirty , forty , fifty , . A: Twenty one . A: So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . D: By nine . C: Two . D: Yeah . D: Um , uh okay . D: Two . A: Yep . D: Come on . A: Uh , nah . A: Okay . D: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . B: Yes . A: So , it's good . D: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . A: Okay . A: Thank you . C: Yeah , I think . D: Oh . D: Nah . D: How am I doing ? D: Yes . D: And I closed your slide-show . A: Okay . A: Back to my uh Yep . D: Which one was the last for you ? D: Uh , dreaming . A: Next please . D: Next . A: So , now uh we have a product . D: Finance . A: Very happy . A: But uh , is it cheap enough ? A: Um , so if uh I'll have a look . A: We have a battery . A: One battery . B: Mm-hmm . C: Cheapest there is . A: Okay , one battery . A: Electronics . A: Advanced chip . C: Expensive . A: Yeah it's the most advanced . A: Chip-on-print . A: We have that one . C: Well , it's the most advanced . A: We have the simple , regular and advanced . C: Advanced . A: We have the adva advanced . A: Kay , so uncurved or flat . A: Nope . A: Single curved or double curved ? A: We have double curved . A: So Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . A: we have half rubber , half plastic . B: Mm , yes . A: No titanium . A: Special colour . A: Yes , yellow . D: Yeah . C: Uh , yellow . B: Mm , yeah . A: Interface , push-button . A: Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . A: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? A: Or one ? C: One . D: One . A: And it's not really a s Yeah , it's this one . C: Joystick uh thing . A: Now , uh button supplement . A: Special colour . A: We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . A: The buttons are regular colour . B: Mm , yeah . A: So , then uh then then then then then then Then Uh , no . C: We're not gonna make it . A: It's too expensive . C: Yeah . C: Wh What what are the costs ? A: So , we have to change something . A: Fifteen Euros . C: Fifteen . A: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . A: Cause we can't lose the battery . A: We can't lose the advanced chip . A: We can't lose the double curve . A: We have rubber , special colour . D: We would have uh n For a remote control . C: A special colour . C: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . A: Oh , no , we No , it's uh Sorry ? C: Yellow ? C: Uh , is it a special colour ? D: I've For a remote control , I think it is . C: What ? C: Yeah . D: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . D: For up down left right . A: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . A: Then we have thirteen Euros . A: Half a Euro too much . A: Exactly the special colours . C: And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber ? A: So That's one Euro . C: One Euro discount . A: So , I don't think that's good . A: Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . A: If Yes . C: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . A: Then it's only thirteen Euros . C: And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? A: So uh yeah . A: Yeah . A: Then you have Or you have to cut this off . C: Uh uh-uh . A: Then it's not good anymore . C: No . A: So , wait . A: Okay . A: I'll have a look . A: We Yellow rubber . C: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it . A: Yeah , normal . C: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . A: Uh One minute , please . C: And it's twelve Euros , I think . A: Uh Is it maximum . A: Um Yeah , it's normal colour . A: But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? C: No . C: Uh , no , no , no . A: Or it's then a regular ? C: Uh Oh , wait wait wait . D: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? B: Yeah . C: Oh yeah . A: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . C: Oh yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , yeah . A: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? C: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . A: Yeah , regular chip . A: But Is it a good design ? C: Uh , yeah . C: Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . C: And you don't have the L_C_D_ . D: If uh If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ? C: So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date . C: Yeah . A: Mm , yes . D: And then uh we move the the colour . D: What will that be ? C: Yeah . A: Then it's okay . C: Huh . C: No knew that . D: Yeah . A: Okay , so no joystick . A: Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . C: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . A: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . A: No joystick . A: Push-buttons . A: No special colour . A: Twelve and a half Euros . A: Then it's okay . A: So , we have to change that a little bit . A: And you cannot use the red and green button . A: Because if you give them a s uh colour , you have to pay point two Euros . B: Okay . B: All the same uh Mm , yeah . C: So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . A: Yes . C: But then the print on it will g um change it . C: Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . C: Uh l How you call it ? B: Recognisable . C: Recognisable , yeah . B: Like what Yeah . A: Yes . B: Mm , yeah . A: So So Well Now we have to change that , but that's okay . C: Yeah ? B: Okay . C: Okay . A: Rubber . A: What's the normal colour ? C: Oh , well that's clear . A: So And Where's ? A: Yeah . A: So , now it's Yeah . C: And the joystick away . C: And its buttons . A: It is . A: But then it will be just that ones . C: Yeah . A: Now it's Very good . D: still , he waited at the No . A: Now , uh project eva evaluation . A: Well What do you think of it ? A: Uh About the project . C: About the process . D: Project . C: Went good . C: Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . C: We have a gun instead of a remote control . C: Um Uh leadership . C: Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . C: So yeah that was clear . C: Team-work okay . C: Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . C: And uh no , uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult . C: But , nah . C: New ideas found . C: Nope . A: Okay . A: And you . B: Yeah , well the same . B: I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah , it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . A: Okay . B: Yeah . D: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . D: I think um Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . D: Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . D: But it not really going very convenient . B: Mm-hmm . D: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there . D: And with a normal mouse . D: Um , and uh the project . D: Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . D: Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . D: And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . D: To tell their opinion . A: Okay . A: Well , what do I have to say . A: I think it was good . A: Not too many discussions . C: No . A: So , it's good for the speed . B: No . C: Yep . A: So , I think we're ready . D: Yeah . A: Good price . A: Evaluation ready . A: Ready . C: Beer . A: That's it . C: Yeah ? D: Okay . C: Okay then .","summary":"The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen. Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria. The overall rating was two. The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros. The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. *NA* The remote will have an LCD screen. The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick. The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour. There was some confusion about the agenda. The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed. Which features should be removed or changed. Which chip would be needed for the revised design.","enhanced_summary":"To finalize the evaluation of their remote control prototype, the team, consisting of A as the secretary, B, C, and D, gathered to discuss the design details and financial aspects. The prototype, presented by B, featured a yellow rubber design with unique features like a double-curved shape and a joystick for volume and channel controls. The team engaged in a detailed evaluation exercise based on various criteria, rating the prototype on technological innovation, target market appeal, and adherence to the company's fashion-forward motto. After a thorough discussion and individual ratings, they calculated an average score, leading to a decision that the prototype met their expectations. However, concerns were raised about the cost-effectiveness of the design, prompting adjustments to reduce the price to \u20ac12.50 per unit by simplifying certain features. The team also reflected on their project evaluation, highlighting aspects like creativity, teamwork, and the use of technology during the process.

A: Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . B: So That's right . B: Ruud . A: Um project kick-off . C: Is there a schedule for this meeting ? A: Yes , there is actually . A: Um I will li list the agenda for today . A: For this meeting . A: Good morning , Ruud . D: Good morning . A: Uh it's important um yeah , great . C: I shall close the door . A: It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Um we're here to develop uh a new product . A: Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . A: Um you are here in a specific role . A: Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . A: Is that correct ? C: That's correct . B: Mm-hmm . A: Okay . A: Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . A: Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . A: Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . B: Alright . C: Okay . C: Um is there any room for a little presentation ? C: Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? A: There is ? A: Yeah , there is . C: Okay . A: No problem . A: Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . A: Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . A: Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . A: Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . B: Okay . A: The market , we should have a look at the market . A: Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . A: Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes . B: Progressions . A: Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that . A: Um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? A: Well in this case control t the the television I think . B: It's for the vision . B: Yeah . A: Um and the last one is the working design . A: How exactly does it work in the technical sense . A: Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . A: So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . A: Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . A: Um as you see now I can give a presentation . A: Um it's also possible to use this one as well . A: You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . A: Um to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . A: Um then we have this electronic white-board system . A: Um yeah , I will show that now . A: Um you can draw on the board using this pen . A: There are little um uh sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . B: Sensors . A: Um well , it it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . A: Okay , so not too fast writing . A: Um you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . A: It's quite the same . A: Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . A: So do not m make a new file . A: Just use this one uh during the day . A: Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . B: But we all use the same white-board file So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? A: Yes . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . B: Yeah , okay . A: It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . B: Yeah , alright . B: Yep . A: Um you can choose the format , um sorry . A: Uh Let me see . A: Um Well I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . A: Yep . A: Current colour , you can choose another colour . A: And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . A: Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . A: Okay . A: Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . A: Um to um oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . A: Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . D: Okay . D: Um green . D: An animal . D: Okay . D: Um Uh a wee rabbit . B: It's a bunny . A: A rabbit . C: Alright . A: Okay , well great . A: Um Roo , could you do the same please ? B: But of course , Flores . A: But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . B: Blank . A: Sebastian is thinking about the animal . C: I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . A: Okay . B: Yeah , I'm think about it too . B: Format . B: Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , right ? A: It it should be a cat . D: Yeah . A: Okay ? C: Well , I'll give it a try . C: Mm . A: I'm guessing a horse . C: Very good . B: With a very small legs . C: I was very good in drawing . B: You should feed that uh that animal . C: Well , I guess you uh get the idea . A: Yes , okay . C: Beautiful . A: Beautiful . A: Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . A: Um any questions well , just just let me know . A: Um okay , back to our project . A: Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . A: Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . A: Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . A: And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . A: Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . C: Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh influations influences . A: Limitations . A: Okay . B: Okay . C: Okay ? A: Okay , great . C: Okay . C: Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . C: I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . C: So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . C: So that's one . C: Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . C: Sorry about that . C: Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . B: Okay . C: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . C: One thing about uh interopera operability . C: Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . C: Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . C: So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . B: And for a cell phone ? C: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . B: Yeah , okay . B: Yeah . C: I think it could come in handy . C: We should discuss that . C: Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . C: We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . C: But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . B: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . C: Mm-hmm . C: But it's cost-effective . B: But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so y you you can Most of them . C: Yes . C: Mm-hmm . C: Well , not all , not all . C: So that's the point . C: So Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . B: Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . B: Yeah . C: So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . A: Yeah . A: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , and Okay , and and uh Okay . C: Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments . A: Okay , good . C: Okay . A: Um that was your presentation ? C: That's it . A: Okay , okay . A: Um okay . A: Great . A: Um I'll go back to my own presentation . A: Um Mm . A: Okay . A: Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . A: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . A: Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . A: Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um so let's start with you . A: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? B: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . B: Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um Yeah uh , what is it , devices ? A: Yep . B: Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . C: Yes , I think it should be something like that . B: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ? A: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not a No . B: Yeah , I do I don't know that . B: It's no I have uh don't have the information for it . C: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? C: No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device . A: No . B: No , okay . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? D: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . A: Okay . A: Okay . B: Um Well , the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . B: That's just the basic f technical function . A: Yeah . B: So that was my really my part for uh this session . B: Um Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . A: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um Okay . C: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: It just should change the T_V_'s state . B: So that's it . B: Um but furthermore Yeah . C: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? C: Or are there any o other controls ? B: Yeah , with buttons . C: Are there only any other cont Well , I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . B: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or But Yeah . A: Uh-huh . C: You know these things . C: And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes , to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . B: They're very vu vulnerable . B: Yeah . C: So maybe that's an idea , I don't know . B: Yeah . B: And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . B: Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . A: Maybe not even pointed . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Okay Uh Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay . C: Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? C: So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . B: Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . B: For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh But Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Okay . B: Two more things . B: Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . B: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . A: Okay , s yeah . A: Yeah . B: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um in dark too . B: So when it's dark Those are two really uh user interface Yeah . A: Okay . A: Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . B: That's perfect . A: Is tha Okay . C: Okay . A: Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . C: Do do you Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them . A: Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ? A: Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? D: Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . A: Mm-hmm . D: And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . A: Because ? D: Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . A: Mm-hmm . D: But uh lots of devices already use infrared . D: So we'll probably have to implement that . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? C: Um oh yes , I remember . C: Um you said something about visibility in the dark . C: Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? B: Yeah . C: Which makes it easier to operate it . B: Yeah . B: Well , maybe I um but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . C: I I don't know . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . B: The uh the the digits in black . C: Mm-hmm . B: Uh then it's already visible in dark . C: Okay . B: So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course . C: Okay . A: Okay . A: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . C: Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . A: So Yeah , twelve Euro fifty , yeah . C: Well , that's more So that's a big problem , I think . D: Yeah . C: I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . C: The cost price is very low . A: Okay . C: Um Okay . B: Just remind something . B: The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . A: Okay , okay . B: You have a m uh Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . C: Very good point . C: Yeah . B: The marks . C: Okay . A: Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . A: Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . A: Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . B: Yeah . C: Okay . A: So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah . B: But um Necessary , yeah . A: I dunno , it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um Well does it ? B: Yeah . C: Hmm . B: But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . B: Cause I think Bluetooth uh Yeah , I know it from the cell phone . C: It's use uh a lot of uh well Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work uh quite okay . A: I'm not sure . A: Uh Yeah . C: So uh technically it will be possible . B: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . C: No , you cannot . A: Okay . B: Does it It's over ? A: Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . C: Okay . A: Um so we will go back to our own uh work . C: Okay . A: Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . A: Um so this was it . B: Okay . A: See you in thirty minutes . B: Great .","summary":"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. The project manager then went over the project budget. The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and\/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow. The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. The project manager closed the meeting. Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks. They will receive information from their personal coaches. The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control. The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros. The remote will be sold internationally. The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros. The remote will control multiple devices. The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies. The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers. It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product. Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the project, Flores gathered the team consisting of Marketing Expert Ruud, User Interface Designer Roo, and Industrial Designer Sebastian for a brainstorming session on developing a new remote control product.

A: The waiting is for Sebastian . A: There he is . B: We have a slight problem . C: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? B: I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . A: Sorry ? C: Can I get a cup of coffee ? A: Uh no . C: Okay . A: You can't , sorry . B: So just cancel it . C: Well , during my work I have no time either . C: So I think so too . A: Well , this is life . A: Sorry uh , Roo . B: Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . A: Okay . B: Accidentally . A: Okay . B: But it's alright . A: People , welcome back with the second meeting . A: Um for now on the schedule are a few points . A: Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . A: Um second , I received um some new project requirements . A: I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? A: Sebastian ? A: Roo ? B: Yeah . A: Ruud ? D: Almost . A: Almost , okay . A: Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . A: Um the top goal of this m Um we will figure that out . B: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . B: Okay . A: Ca can you try to Yeah , w we will see . D: Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the . B: I don't think it's wireless here . A: Um it is , yeah . C: It is . B: Or it is . C: It is . B: Yeah ? B: Okay , great . D: Uh okay . A: Yeah . A: Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . A: Um we have forty minutes . A: So it's now Yep . A: Okay . A: Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . A: So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . A: It's a board decision . A: Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . B: Yeah . B: Time , yeah . A: Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . A: Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . A: Um then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . A: So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . B: Yes . A: Is that clear ? A: Any questions on these requirements ? A: No ? A: Okay . A: Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? B: Yeah , I'll start . A: Uh uh yeah . C: Yes . A: Okay , great . B: Um Oh , how can I uh Geez , and sli and show . B: Um Just uh press it . B: Uh yes . B: Alright . B: Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . B: Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . B: So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . A: Yeah . B: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . A: Mm-hmm . B: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . A: Yeah . B: Um but um yeah . B: My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . B: But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . A: Uh-huh . B: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . B: But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . B: So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . B: But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . A: Okay . A: Uh Ruud , did you get that ? D: Yeah , uh b uh most . B: Yeah . A: Okay , so the important thing here is In the market , yeah . B: And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . D: Oh , user-friendly . B: Yeah , what what does the market want ? B: I I don't know . A: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh Yeah . B: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . A: Okay . A: Sebastian . C: Okay . C: Excuse me . B: Scusi . C: Um Okay , it's still the right thing . C: Okay . C: Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . C: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . C: And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . C: Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable . B: Energies and uh Yeah . C: Can you see it ? A: No , it's not visible . C: No ? C: Well Um , there's a energy source here . C: And um basically there it's connected to three things . C: The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . C: That's basically the idea . C: And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . C: Okay . C: Um what have I found . C: Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . C: That's all . C: It's cased together , nothing more than that . C: It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . C: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . C: And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . C: And I think that's what we w yes . B: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . C: In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . C: So maybe we should consider that . A: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Okay . C: I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . C: Um basically this is all there is . C: There's just one chip . C: There are a few buttons connected . C: Uh the buttons are lit . C: And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . C: So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . C: There's nothing more to it . A: So it's fairly easy . C: It's fairly easy . C: It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . A: Okay . B: Succeed in it also . A: Okay , good . C: So Okay , so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . C: So I think that uh should be clear . A: Okay . C: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . C: Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . C: And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . C: Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . A: Okay . C: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . C: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . B: And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or Okay . C: No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . C: So we can use them . C: So that's no problem . B: For the same costs , it's can be uh in our Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh Yeah . C: Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making We can we can make its I think . D: Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . D: So , the channel switching . A: Yeah . D: Or Hmm , true . A: Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . C: Okay . B: But I think Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . C: Hmm . C: Yes . C: Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . C: No no no , no . C: That's right , that's right . A: Okay . C: So well , this uh should be it . A: Okay . C: Um have a think about it . A: Yeah . A: Okay , Ruud . D: Oh , mine is already outdated . A: Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . D: Since uh Okay , make Well Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . A: So any income is welcome . A: Input . D: Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . B: Could you step a little bit more to the right ? A: Okay . B: Yeah , thank you . D: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . D: But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea . D: Uh well , skip this . A: Yeah . D: Well , it's this till true , of course . D: That they only use ten percent the buttons . D: The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . D: And the volume button's only four times . D: So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . D: And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . C: Mm . D: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . D: Some uh audio signal . D: Like uh home phones . A: Okay . D: Or Yeah . A: Well , that's interesting . C: Or a find a finding function , you know . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , that's definitely interesting . C: That's quite a yes . A: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . B: Sound signal . B: Yeah . A: Okay , go on . C: Yes . D: Well , I just said that . D: And uh well , this obvious , and he also said it . A: Okay . A: So that's what the market tells us . D: Uh that's about it , yes . A: Yep . A: Okay . B: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . D: Uh mo uh zap buttons most . B: So Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . D: Volume , they are uh use a lot . D: But more than all the other buttons . D: So Yeah , that's uh a problem . C: Yes . B: And first um Yeah . C: Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . A: Yep . C: Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . C: There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . C: So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . C: So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . C: So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . B: Yeah , the sound signal . B: Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? C: Well Yes . C: Th that's a bit of that's a problem . B: Another device is not a solution . D: Yeah . A: Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like um turning on and off the the the lights . C: Usually Oh yes . B: It should be uh uh Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . C: Yes . C: Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . C: Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . C: You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . A: Reports rep respend response to it . C: And um Yes . B: Yeah , just like uh the phones the But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . C: Yes , that's it . C: Yes , same thing . D: Yeah . A: But uh th Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um Okay . C: No , so we we should use something else . D: And you Yeah , and usually And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , and it's And b So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . B: Uh But I believe you will have an I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . C: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . C: Yes , m yes . C: S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about It's quite complicated . A: So what about the clapping technique ? A: Um because you se Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh Yeah , a peak . C: Well , it's quite complicated . C: Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . C: Yes , yes . C: Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . A: Yeah , that's true . C: Yes , so we don't want that . B: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . C: Maybe we can Something like that . B: Just a little antenna or uh something . B: Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . C: Well , is there not something f something more easily Well , I don't think uh . A: Well uh Yeah . B: Uh that's just uh just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . C: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . C: And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . C: You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . C: Yes , something like that . C: But that will be very costly , I think . C: So that's not a good idea . A: Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . D: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise . C: I will . B: Yeah . C: Yes . C: Yes . C: But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yep . C: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . C: And there are some implepe imp Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . B: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? B: It's a unique item uh It will be an a unique feature of our remote control . C: So Okay . A: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . A: It's a different exactly . D: Yeah . A: It's an uni an unique feature , and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . B: Yeah . B: And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . A: Yeah . B: What should we choose in in design ? A: Yeah . A: Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . B: Well , the extra functions . A: So Okay . D: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . D: Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . B: Used option . A: Okay . A: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . D: Uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . A: Yeah . A: Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . D: So Yeah . A: Well , we skip that . D: Yeah . D: So Nope . B: Well , so it just th the basic functions . A: Okay . B: And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . C: No , no . A: No . B: So Yeah . C: So that's out of the question . A: Yeah . C: So I think also . B: Just through uh the easy uh design . A: Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . B: We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . C: Yes . B: So Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . C: Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and Yeah , that's right . A: No . A: Yeah . A: Okay , Ruud , how do you feel about that ? A: Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple Mm-hmm . D: Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . A: Mm yeah . D: So And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . A: Okay , so this is is kind of uh Yeah . C: Mm . C: Okay . C: Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . C: You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . C: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless Mm-hmm . A: But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? C: Mm-hmm . C: Ok like that . C: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . C: I don't know if if it's user-friendly . C: That's your field of expertise . B: Yeah , I don't know yet . A: Because we do not implement uh a user history . C: Mm-hmm . C: There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . A: I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um Yeah . C: W Mm-hmm . C: Well , maybe we can use a light for that . C: When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . C: So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . C: Something like that . C: Yes . A: Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . B: But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a Um it's already uh oh , we have a blank . A: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . B: Oh . C: Oh yeah , something like that . C: It's not really a stick , but Yes . B: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . C: Yes . B: Instead of a stick . B: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . C: Hmm . A: Yeah , it can break down . C: Yes , yes . D: Yeah . C: And Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . C: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . B: Yeah . D: A younger uh Huh . C: But you're the marketing man . D: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . B: Geez . B: Well , volume and something uh like that . A: Uh-huh . B: The programme up and down . A: Okay , yeah . B: And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . C: Okay , that's good . A: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . A: Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . A: Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . A: We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . C: Mm-hmm . B: But I think our our next step to look at is just that . B: So I don't think it's um we have something to do . B: Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . A: Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . B: Yes ? A: Yeah . A: We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience . B: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . B: Kay , but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . C: Okay . C: Do do you want a list of functions ? C: Do you want an explicit list ? C: Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? A: Um well , I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: Mm-hmm . B: The ten digits . A: Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . A: l how is the remote going to look ? B: Oh , and just one function . A: Not not in the user interface , but Yeah . B: The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yes . A: A bit of a split mode . C: Change . A: Uh l like Yeah . C: Yes , yes . A: Dual channel watch . C: Yes . B: Yeah . A: Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . C: Well you're the secretary . A: Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? D: Mielsen . A: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen . A: Right . A: Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . A: So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . C: Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . B: Alright . A: Um Yeah , that's that's if you want to do it , Sebastian . D: Yeah . C: Sure . B: Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh The ten digits ? A: Okay , um Okay , so so um uh Volume . A: Programme . A: Uh dual channel . A: Uh And and do we want um the ten digits ? C: Yes , that's important . B: Yeah , I believe so . C: Well , are are you sure ? D: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . C: I'm not so sure . B: Yeah . C: Well , that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? A: Yeah . C: Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that . B: I wouldn't buy it personally . C: If it were so . B: A remote control without the ten digits . C: Okay , I can imagine when I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . B: Uh and I think the most Just elder elder people would would buy it , but Yep . A: I agree actually . D: Well But Yeah , and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . C: But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . A: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . C: That's enough . B: The older people only use five of them . C: Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ? A: Often . D: So Well And And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . C: No , you're probably right . B: Yeah . C: Okay . C: But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . C: Don't you think ? A: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the You c you can d make them very fancy by um I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . C: The design . B: On the design . C: Okay . C: Well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it . C: Mm-hmm . B: Yeah . A: So I'm I'm I do not agree Uh Exactly , exactly . C: Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . C: Okay . D: Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for Yeah . A: Okay , speech . C: Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . B: Yeah . C: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . A: Yeah . C: That's one thing . C: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . A: To find yeah . C: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . C: But maybe when we uh Mm-hmm . A: Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um Yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay , okay . D: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . D: So then we should implement such a but Yes . A: But we do focus on younger people . A: We d it it's a board uh decision . C: Okay . C: Well . C: I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . B: So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . A: Okay . C: Yes . C: Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . C: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function . B: Mm-hmm . C: So that's that's a big advantage , I think . A: Okay . A: Okay , g good . A: Okay . C: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . C: Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . C: So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . A: Mm . C: But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . A: Yep . C: There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . A: Okay . C: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . A: But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? C: You have to do nothing for it . D: M And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . A: Because it seems like a very Is a cradle very cheap ? B: Twelve dollar fifty . C: Maybe , maybe not . C: I'll have to find that out . C: Yes . C: So No , that's very cheap . D: Cause when Yeah . C: It's Oh , it's very cheap . C: That's no problem . C: It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . A: I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well . C: It's Yes , but they're they're mass production . C: They're very cheap . C: So it will cost us p practically nothing . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . A: Um I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . A: Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . A: Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? D: Um I think we dealt with the most important information . D: Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . D: So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . D: But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . A: Okay . D: So I don't think that's a big problem Yes . A: Okay . C: Yeah . A: Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable . C: Profitable . D: Yeah , profitable . A: We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . D: Yes . A: Okay . A: O okay . A: Um Roo . B: I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . A: Nothing to add . A: Sebastian ? C: Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . A: Yeah ? A: Great . C: Um so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . C: So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . C: So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . C: But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . C: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . C: Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . C: The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . A: Yep . C: Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . C: If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . C: So that's another well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . A: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? A: The the board Yeah . C: And this even uh makes it more cheapy . C: So Mm-hmm . B: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? A: The board . B: The circuit board . C: The circuit board . B: The fewer buttons you can use on it . C: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . A: No , it's th yeah . B: Yeah , okay . A: It's the other way around , yeah . B: Yeah . C: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . C: So that's that's another advantage . A: It shouldn't be a big issue . B: Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . C: So Yes , because I don't know Yes . C: I d I really don't know . C: So It can be costly . B: No . A: Okay . C: Maybe not . A: I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . A: Maybe you will get some information on that . C: Yes . A: Um I'm not sure how how that Yep . C: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it . A: Okay , great . A: Um well , I think we're qui quite done . B: We're done , I think . A: Um for now we will have the lunch break . C: How nice . A: Um I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . B: Me neither . A: Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . A: Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . A: If you want to look at it um well , just do . A: Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . A: Uh Roo , um from you I would like to see Uh I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . B: Interface industrial . B: Yeah . A: User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . C: Well , we understand . A: And um Well , i it should be easy , that's w w what we concluded . B: Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . C: Well Mm yes . B: About the voice recognition . B: Well Yeah . A: It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . A: S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . A: And um um yeah , some some fancy lights . A: I think that's what we decided . C: So we drop the voice recognition ? A: No no no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the No . C: Or Oh . C: Okay . C: Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ? A: We can decide the next meeting . C: Okay . A: Yep . C: Because I'll have some updated info on that uh Adapt . A: Yeah . A: I guess all of you have i updated info . A: I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . B: Yep . A: And I'm sure the market will um uh uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . D: Hmm . B: Adapt . D: Left . D: Hmm . A: Um yeah , that's it for now . B: That's it . B: Kay . A: Any other questions or can we have the lunch ? C: We can have the lunch . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , okay . B: I'll take the lunch . A: Good .","summary":"There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design. The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost. The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder. The ID will present the components concept. The UI will present the user interface concept. The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends. LED's can be used to light up the remote. Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost. It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote. A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants. Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented. The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition. A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption. LED's would signify extra energy consumption. Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive. It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote. They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds. Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly. Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs. There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull. Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way. The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well. However, this solution may prove too expensive. An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the second meeting, the team gathered to discuss new project requirements and presentations. The focus was on deciding the product features, target group, and remote control functions within a tight 40-minute timeframe. They decided to exclude teletext support due to being outdated and to limit the remote to TV functions only to meet market demands and time constraints. Emphasizing a user-friendly design for customers under 40, incorporating the corporate image, and considering cost-effective components were key decisions. Action-items included Roo presenting the user interface concept and Sebastian exploring voice recognition costs. The team debated the inclusion of ten digits versus voice recognition for channel selection, balancing advanced features with simplicity. They discussed the potential for a solar-powered rechargeable design and the need for a cost-effective approach.

The focus was on deciding the product features, target group, and remote control functions within a tight 40-minute timeframe. They decided to exclude teletext support due to being outdated and to limit the remote to TV functions only to meet market demands and time constraints. Emphasizing a user-friendly design for customers under 40, incorporating the corporate image, and considering cost-effective components were key decisions. Action-items included Roo presenting the user interface concept and Sebastian exploring voice recognition costs. The team debated the inclusion of ten digits versus voice recognition for channel selection, balancing advanced features with simplicity. They discussed the potential for a solar-powered rechargeable design and the need for a cost-effective approach.

{"meeting_id":"TS3011c","dialogue":"A: Do you need to change anything on it ? D: Um Mm , don't think so . A: Because otherwise I will already open it . A: Okay . D: Unless uh things have suddenly change again . A: Is it much changes ? D: Uh don't know . D: Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time . A: Uh I didn't No no . A: I do hot have Only the same information . D: Okay . A: Hello , Sebastian . C: Hello hello Mister P_M_ . A: I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room . C: Well , that's where the thinking goes on . A: Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . A: Bongiorno . B: Bongiorno . C: I think you should punish him . C: You're the P_M_ . A: Hmm . B: Punish . A: I see some interesting okay . C: Possibilities , yeah ? B: You wish . A: People , welcome back . B: Welcome . A: The third meeting . B: Uh Yeah . D: Oop . A: Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . A: Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? A: If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . A: Um the second thing , um I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . A: That's quite strange . C: Yes . A: Okay . C: So Not at all . A: We'll come to that later , I g I think . A: Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? B: No . D: No . A: Okay . A: Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . A: Forty minutes in total for this . A: So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . C: Okay . A: Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . D: Kay . D: Hmm ? B: Alright . D: Oh . C: Just press the okay button , it works . D: Yeah , Okay . A: Um yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: My method ? C: How surprising . D: Well , findings . D: Uh Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . D: And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material . D: Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . D: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . D: Simple shapes uh m material . D: But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group 'Kay . A: Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide ? C: Oh wait uh wait up . A: Um because I'm taking minutes and it Um were the important themes enclose . A: Yeah okay . A: The feel of to be spongy Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . C: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? D: Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . D: Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . C: Not something dull . C: Okay . B: But they like dark colours , you said in the p Okay . D: No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . B: Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . D: But Which one ? B: I had Or we could make oh . C: But can you can you go back to that slide ? C: The uh just one slide back , no no no . D: This ? C: Yes . C: Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy . D: Yes . C: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? D: Uh well , it might . D: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . D: But Maybe soft material or something . D: But not a real sponge . A: It it maybe it rubber or or yeah . D: Yeah , exactly . A: Okay . D: Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So Well , this this is an example of what they would like . C: Okay . D: But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . A: Yeah . D: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . A: Well , that's interesting . C: It's quite interesting . A: You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . B: Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . C: Yes . B: The yellow uh rubber telephone . A: Yeah , yeah . B: It's the it's the rubber uh cover . A: Yeah , it is , it is i yeah . B: And it's uh colourful . B: It looks likes a banana . A: Yeah . B: We have the fruit , we have the colours . A: Do you know the phone ? B: We have the simple design . C: I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it . A: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , the very You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? B: Um thirty five . C: Oh , that one , yes . B: And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow . C: Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know . C: Yes , I I've seen it . C: I've seen it . A: About th Okay . D: I've seen it , but 'Kay . A: Okay . A: Um uh okay . A: Do you have uh thit that was Okay . D: Uh that's about it . A: Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . D: Yes . A: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . D: Uh soft material . A: Okay . C: So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . C: And what was even more important ? D: Uh the fancy look and feel . C: Okay . C: So that's the most important thing for our customers . D: Yes . D: Apparently . A: Okay , Roo , could you do your presentation ? B: Yeah . B: Mm-hmm . B: Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . B: Um Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . A: Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . B: Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . B: These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape . A: Shape . B: So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . B: But it didn't work . B: My pen didn't load um the information . B: So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint . B: But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . C: Mm-hmm . C: But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good . B: Uh yellow . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . C: Yes . A: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , s because um Yeah . C: Slippery . B: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . C: You have to grab it . B: So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed . A: Yeah , exactly . A: Yeah . C: Yes . C: There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . A: Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah . B: Yeah . C: So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . C: It's it's a lot easier . A: Yeah . C: So m Yes . A: It grips automatically . A: Yeah , okay . C: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . A: Okay , good . B: Great . B: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . B: And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . A: Yeah . A: Way too much I think for our goal , yeah . B: Yeah . B: So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . A: Okay , b but I think we'll yeah . C: Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . C: Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . C: Uh these are the things we've looked at . C: And of course I used the web to uh find my information . C: About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . C: We have the uncurved or flat case . C: Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . C: I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . C: We have uh a curved one . C: It's uh curved in two dimensions . C: You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . C: So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . A: Okay . C: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . C: I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . B: Yeah . C: The the big remote control , something like that . B: Right . C: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . C: Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . C: We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . C: We can use wood and titanium . C: Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . C: And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . C: Which brings me to the different energy sources . C: Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . C: You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . B: Great . A: Well , it would be very new to the market , but Yeah . C: Uh Well , this is quite interesting . C: Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . C: So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . B: Like the watch . C: It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . C: And you can store the energy in the in the thing . A: I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . C: Mm-hmm . C: It's very funny indeed . A: I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . C: Mm-hmm . C: Indeed . A: Um hand dynamo Well , maybe m Yeah , I know . B: But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . C: Mm-hmm . B: You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch . C: Yes . A: Yeah . C: But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . C: the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . C: But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . C: So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , well , m it might not work . A: Yeah . A: And wha Okay . C: So that's something you have to keep in mind . C: So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries . A: Yeah . A: Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . C: Uh yes , it does . A: Yeah . C: I'll come to that later . A: Okay . C: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . C: The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . C: And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . C: So it's just like a mouse . C: You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . C: Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . B: Mm-hmm . C: So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four Yes . B: Mm-hmm . B: Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . C: That is possible too . C: Yes . B: But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . C: Mm-hmm . B: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . A: Well This will be the remote , right ? B: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . C: Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . C: Maybe when you integrate some functions . B: Yeah . A: Um with uh maybe a channel selector . A: What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? B: Yeah , uh that's a possibility , but But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for A volume , okay . C: Uh it's do it's done before . A: Because this is how you keep it Volume ? C: Yes . C: It's quite quite good , yes . C: Well , it's it well , i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . C: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . C: You just use the wheel . A: Well , what about mute ? C: About mute . C: Well , yes . A: Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button . C: Okay . C: Yes . A: And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device . C: Well , okay . C: Well , that that that's one possibility , okay . C: Well , okay . A: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . C: It's quite goods . A: So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yes . A: So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . B: Yeah . A: Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? D: Um Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . A: Uh scroll-wheel . B: Wheel . D: So it might attract uh the young customers . C: Hmm . A: Okay . C: But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . C: We use this . A: Yeah . C: And Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . C: So maybe it's not no . A: Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . A: Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . C: Hmm . C: Yes , but it uses two separate buttons . A: Yeah . A: I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . C: It doesn't use a . A: No . A: Yeah . C: Well . C: Uh something for uh Roo here . A: For you too , yeah . B: Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . B: You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . C: Wi within reach . C: Yes , you have to . B: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . C: Yes . C: yes . C: Yeah , yeah . A: Okay . C: Okay . A: Sebastian . A: Um Yeah . C: Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . C: There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . C: There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . C: There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . C: So that's a limitation . C: About um the components , uh just the hardware . C: We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . C: Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . C: And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . C: But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . B: Yeah yeah , you can um I have some information about it . B: Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . C: Mm-hmm . C: Okay . C: Okay . C: So so okay . B: Of mute , let's say mute . B: Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yeah . B: So that's the sample sensor . C: Okay . B: So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . C: Mm-hmm . A: It performs the action . A: Yeah . C: Okay . B: So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . A: Yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . C: Okay . C: This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . C: Um no op I'm not very sure . C: No , it's not in here . C: If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . C: If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . C: And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper . A: Okay . A: Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display ? C: Okay . A: To No . C: Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about . B: Yeah . B: Well , I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display . B: Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , yeah . C: I I don't think either . C: No . C: I don't think you need it . A: On screen display . A: Yeah . C: Okay . A: Okay th Okay . C: Okay , well my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . C: I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . C: So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . C: Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . C: It's more reliable , it's cheaper . C: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . A: Good . A: Kineti okay . C: The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . D: Hmm . C: It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . A: Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , too yeah . C: Otherwise it will not too advanced , uh well . C: It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . C: But Yes . A: Yeah , but that that's the same with the solar cell . A: That's no different . C: And I think it's more robust . C: It's more uh Uh it's more functional . A: Yeah . A: Okay . B: But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? B: So if you use titanium Okay . A: No no , but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . C: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . A: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . A: But but yet , I understood that the market is different . B: Oh , sorry . B: Yeah . A: So um No , r rubber with colours . C: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that . B: Yeah . D: And yeah , the yeah , the older people liked wood . B: And I would think And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? C: Oh okay , sorry . C: So it it needs to be rubber . D: No the Yeah , the younger people liked soft material . A: Colourful and Yeah . C: Okay . C: Okay , spongy materials . D: Yeah . C: Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . C: So Yes , they can . C: But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple Well , I'm not very sure . B: Okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh , evalu But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . C: Maybe that's an uh a different I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . A: But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or I it's too dull . D: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: I don't think c our customers will like it . C: And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . A: Yeah . C: So I think this is the best of two worlds . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: Okay , what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? A: Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . C: Yes . A: Because it it's of cour Yeah . C: It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . C: It's very unlogical . C: Well the there has to be some pointing at . A: Well It depends also on your on your Well , it depends on your walls actually . C: But All lights get absorbed , yeah . B: Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . A: If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . B: Yeah . A: But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . C: Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . A: So Yeah . C: So it has an it's easier . C: Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . C: Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . C: Um with a with a regular chip . B: And the regular chip . C: I think uh it gives us the advantage of Yes , yes . B: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . B: Yeah . A: I like the scroll wheels uh idea . C: And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . A: Yeah . C: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . B: No . C: So Okay . B: Think so too . A: Well , it looks uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , and I mean L_C_D_ is well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard than than Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . C: Technology . C: Yes . C: It's not very flashy and new . D: Standard ? A: That's the problem . C: Mm-hmm . A: Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . C: Mm-hmm . C: Yes . B: But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . A: Mm yeah . C: Uh I think our customers will go insane . A: Okay , okay . C: It's it's too much . A: Yeah . A: Okay , I I agree . A: I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or No ? D: Nah , um n no , I don't think so . D: M Hmm . A: Sebast uh nee , Roo ? A: Roo , do you have any other Nothing more . B: Um no . B: Nothing more . A: Um Sebas Well , we we need to describe uh decisions now . C: Okay . C: Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ? C: Okay . A: So um on the energy , well , we decided . C: So i Okay . A: Chip . C: Okay . A: The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . C: Okay , okay . A: User interface um Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . B: Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? C: Yes , they can work . B: Yeah , okay . B: Sorry , yeah . C: They cannot work with double-curved . B: Oh , sorry . C: That's that's problem . B: Yeah . C: I'll check it for you . A: I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . A: Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . B: Yeah . A: Keep it in mind . A: And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . A: The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . C: Yes . C: Mm-hmm . A: The user interface design . A: And for you , the product evaluation . A: Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . A: Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . C: Okay . A: And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . C: Okay . C: So you will be on the Bahamas . B: The project drawing is for the next Yeah , right . C: Uh Okay . A: Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . C: So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? A: Yeah ? A: I can . A: Um maybe one of you could write it down . C: I'll do . A: Great . A: Um Uh you you need to help me . A: Um The casing is curved , single-curved . C: Okay . C: W start with the casing . B: Single-curved . C: Okay , single-curved case . C: Okay . C: What about the energy source ? A: Traditional batteries uh and solar . B: But can there be uh wor can they work together ? B: Or do we have to choose between them ? B: Cause if we have to choose yeah ? A: No , they can be complementary . C: I I think they can . A: Uh al al I uh Every device Yeah . C: Yes . B: Okay . C: Well , uh It it should be . B: What if not ? C: There should be really no problem . C: They can be supplementary . B: Okay . C: That's no problem . C: So So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . A: Okay , um th Battery and solar , yeah . C: Okay . C: What about uh the finishing of the case ? C: We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? A: Yeah , with colourful rubber . B: Yeah . A: Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . C: Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . C: Something like black and red . C: uh black and yellow . A: Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . B: Grey and yellow . C: Grey yellow , okay . A: Yeah . B: Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . A: Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . A: Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours . C: Oh , I think it's uh it's not very dull . C: It's quite modern actually . C: Don't you think ? A: Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . B: I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button . B: And um Well well Well , there is . A: Well , it it doesn't have to be red . A: Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . A: Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess . C: Hmm . C: Okay . D: Or black and yellow . A: Black and yellow , yeah . C: Okay , but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . C: Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . C: But Oh , I've read . B: Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh No . D: Yeah . C: Yes . C: Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . C: They're actually very slow in its techniques . A: Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . C: So So I'm afraid it's not possible . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Um more f more more decisions we made . A: Um Um The scroll-heel . B: A scroll-wheel . A: Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . B: Voice recognition , of course . C: Okay , so scroll-wheel . C: But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . A: Yeah . C: And th the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too . A: Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . B: What what did you say ? C: Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . C: So it has th the spongy uh feel also . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So I I think that's okay . B: Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . B: In the rubber . A: I think rubber is nice . A: Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i . B: Yeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . B: What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . A: Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ? B: It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from No , but but uh it Yeah , b yeah . D: Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? D: Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . A: Yeah . A: You could place a um uh this this would be the button . D: There the icons . A: The scroll-wheel , I mean . A: And you could place the indica th th the signals the No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber . C: Yes . D: So you don't touch the icons that much . C: That's okay . B: Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . B: So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . B: Yeah . B: Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus . C: Yes , the signs . B: You have to draw the Yeah , it's on the cover . A: Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . A: Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . B: So if you uh You just move the problem . A: What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? C: Uh I see what you mean . C: Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . C: So maybe they can combine these two . A: Yeah . A: Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A: A plastic cover with rubber finishing . A: I mean , this is this is the finishing . A: This is um what's on the edge . A: What you feel . C: Yeah . A: But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . C: Mm-hmm . A: I mean I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ? C: Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . B: Y uh can you separate these uh these I do . C: So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . A: I mean , I I never touch between the buttons . C: I think both . C: I do . B: Or the s uh the sideways . C: I think Okay . B: Or the the back . A: Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . B: Or the back . A: The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ? B: I think Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . B: So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it . A: Okay . A: Well , we do not have very much time uh left . A: Um I guess you two have to figure that out . B: Yeah . A: I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . B: Yeah . A: Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? C: Um not quite . C: Um what about uh the chips ? C: We use the regular chip ? B: Regular . C: Okay . A: Yeah . C: And Well no , I think that's about it . B: Use with . C: Yes . A: Okay . A: With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . A: The chip is is not really Okay , well . C: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . C: That's all . C: And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . A: Yeah . C: So Okay . A: Okay . A: Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . A: Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um Yeah ? B: For the finishing touch . A: Yeah , um if you write wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ? C: Okay . B: Uh yeah . A: Yeah . B: But um Sebastian has everything . A: I know , but well Great . C: I'll put it online . A: Right .","summary":"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours. The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype. They will think about ways to make their product different from the others in the market. They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface. The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote. The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation. Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups. A scroll wheel will be included in the design. A regular chip will be needed for this. A single-curved rubber casing can also be used. LCD is not going to be implemented. The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells. It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches. The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project. Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work. LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much. The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone. Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department. The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber. It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the third meeting, the team gathered to discuss the progress made on the remote control project. Participants included Sebastian, Miss Tentel, Roo, and Mister P_M_. The meeting began with a review of individual presentations, focusing on market trends favoring innovation, colorful designs, and soft materials. Roo highlighted the importance of a fancy look and feel, especially for the younger target group. The team delved into decisions regarding the casing, opting for a single-curved rubber design with grey and yellow corporate colors. They debated the use of rubber vs. plastic for buttons, considering the desired spongy feel. The discussion extended to energy sources, with a preference for traditional batteries and solar power. Sebastian emphasized the need for a regular chip to support advanced functions like voice recognition. Action items included finalizing the design with rubber buttons, exploring the possibility of a plastic cover with rubber finishing, and ensuring decisions were documented in the shared folder. The team aimed to have a prototype ready in thirty minutes, aligning with the target revenue of \u20ac50 million for the innovative remote control project.","relevance":0.208888948,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the team's preference for the casing design of the remote control?","answer":"The team decided on a single-curved rubber casing with grey and yellow corporate colors."},{"question":"What were the chosen energy sources for the remote control project?","answer":"The team opted for traditional batteries and solar power, which could work together as complementary sources."},{"question":"What chip type did the team select for the remote control project?","answer":"The team chose to use a regular chip to support advanced functions like voice recognition."},{"question":"What action items were discussed for the team to work on after the meeting?","answer":"Finalizing the design with rubber buttons, exploring the possibility of a plastic cover with rubber finishing, and ensuring decisions were documented in the shared folder."}]}
{"meeting_id":"TS3011d","dialogue":"B: That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . C: Like this one . B: But uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers . C: It's important . C: Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . C: Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . C: And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . C: But other users who are new to this device need something like that . A: Okay . C: They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them Yeah , maybe so . A: Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A: A a and the voice recognition as well , th maybe you could uh could uh Yeah . C: Yes , it's Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um . C: There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . C: It's it's quite easy . A: Okay . A: Okay , good . A: And and the case is is rubber ? C: Yes , rubber ? A: And the buttons ? B: Plastic or rubber . C: There are plastic or rubber . B: Well , yeah . A: Okay , and uh the colouring ? C: Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that . A: with with grey or black . C: Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . A: Okay , we'll we'll come to that later . A: Um okay . A: Anything else to add or Yeah . C: No . C: Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . D: Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . C: But Yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . A: M uh yeah . C: Or not ? A: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . D: You Yes . C: Well okay . C: Okay , yeah , that's right . C: Or something li like that . B: And a button for disabling the voice recognition . A: Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay , that that's not really really important . C: Yes . B: Yeah . B: That's the basic idea , yeah . A: The basic okay . B: Of our prototype . A: Okay . A: Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? A: Okay . D: Uh my name is not name but Uh well , I used the the uh documents . A: You are nameless . D: And these uh were the most important criteria . D: It should be . D: yeah , that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . C: Is it spongy ? D: Fancy look and feel . D: So Uh well appar Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . B: So just walk through it step by step . B: I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe uh I believe it's fancy . C: I believe it's fancy too . A: No . B: Oh , sorry . D: So Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria . C: Okay . A: Okay , so this these are the cr uh the criteria . A: Okay , well the then we'll switch to my presentation . D: So uh that's about it . A: Um The production costs . A: The costs are not under Can I Um this is the Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . B: Twenty two . B: Yikes . A: And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . C: Well it's very expensive . A: So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important . C: Okay . B: Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa yeah . A: Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . B: The number of uh yeah . C: Okay . A: Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . A: Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . B: And and does it But that's that's only for the buttons . A: Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: Um Yeah , I believe Uh , push-button , well It makes it the thirteen yeah . A: Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . C: Hmm . A: So um yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . C: Okay . A: Um Yeah . C: But I'm afraid it's not complete . C: Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . C: And you have not added one item there . C: So it's c way too expensive . A: It's still too expensive , yeah . A: Um I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out , um oh . B: So the button we can use plastic . A: And uh maybe not use the special form . B: And the pla uh And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . C: But it Yes . A: It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . A: But it's the board decision . A: Um And um yeah . C: Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , I know . C: So Type of m maybe another market segment . A: Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um Yeah . C: Yeah . C: Yes . C: That's maybe that's better . C: Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked . A: Yeah . A: I know , I know . C: So we should kick the board's uh Well Hmm . A: Yeah . A: Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . A: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . C: Yes . A: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . A: Definitely not , no . A: It's not that innovative . A: Or however you s pronounce that . A: Um so , okay . B: Yeah , too bad . A: Um Oh , this is the wrong one . A: So uh that means redesign . A: We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . B: Mm-hmm . A: Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . A: Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . A: I guess Yeah . D: Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway Uh Yay . A: Yeah , that's true . C: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . A: We l we can learn . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So Is it fancy ? A: I agree . A: Well I d it is it is Yeah , I think so . D: Is it ? D: Is it fancy ? B: Um the yellow rubber , I think so . C: I think so . A: You like the rubber , uh Roo . B: I'm into it . D: So uh one ? C: But it's not that fancy . A: Yeah . A: No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . C: I mean I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . C: It would be even more oh , you really like titanium . A: You like tita That's a flavour as well . C: I'm I'm into it . C: It has flavour . C: Yes , that's right . C: You should taste it . A: Right . A: Um Yeah , I know , but but it but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of Yeah . D: Is it uh And w yeah , w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials . C: It has to do with fashion , I guess . C: So do Okay . B: It's trendy trendy , fun yeah . D: So in that way It it's fancy . A: Yeah . A: It applies . A: It yeah . B: Well , just give it a two . A: Yeah . C: Yes . C: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . B: It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but Yeah , but that's sti that's uh Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case . C: It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . C: So Yes . B: We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . B: That's two out of three . B: So I believe uh we are close uh to two . A: Yeah , I I agree . C: Yes , I agree too . C: It's okay . C: We did yes , we did good . D: Okay , and uh was it innovative ? A: Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . B: But that's not in it . D: Yep . B: Ov or can we Okay . C: Well , let's let's this product . C: So I I I think it is . A: This prototype . C: I think it's innovative . A: Yeah . B: And the scroll uh wheel . B: The solar not many remotes have the solar , I think . C: No . C: It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but I think uh it's a two . D: Yeah , and uh So uh also a uh two ? A: That would have been a thrill . A: Yep . D: Is it easy to use ? A: I'm not sure . B: Yeah . A: I'm not sure . B: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . B: Well , hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly . C: Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . B: They won't use it . C: What you see here is is the basic part . C: Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . A: Yeah . C: That's for a novice user . C: When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . C: So in that in that way it is advanced , and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . A: Yeah . C: So uh It's maybe it's not very uh easy for Okay . B: I think I think a three . B: Wouldn't give it more . A: Uh I'm doubting doubting as well . A: Um Yeah . D: Well the p the most important function is easy to use . D: The the zapping , channel switching , volume . D: But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . A: Okay . A: Uh two or three ? A: Three ? A: Wha wh what would be your guess ? A: I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . A: It's the uh it's it's overall . A: Is the device easy to use ? C: Yeah , that's right . C: You're right in that , but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So After all , I think personally I would give a two . A: Um Okay . C: But So , it's two , two and three . A: Uh Roo , a three ? B: Yep . A: Ruud ? D: Good question . D: Uh I'll go uh for the two . A: Okay . C: Two threes . C: So that's ten . A: So I could make it e easy ? B: If you make it a four it will be three in general . C: So that's w No , two and a half . B: If he makes it a four . C: Six and four . B: Not a three . C: Six and four is ten . C: Divided by four is two and a half . C: So Yes . B: Darn . B: Nee . D: Hmm ? A: Roo . D: Huh ? B: A seven , a three No . D: Yeah . B: A four and a three together . D: I yeah . C: Four ? B: Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . D: Yeah , two , two , three No . C: Two ? B: Three ? B: And a three ? A: No , I haven't said anything yet . B: Nee . B: I know . A: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . C: Divided by four . A: Divided by four is two point five . B: Yes . B: So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . B: Then you would make a four . B: If you fill out a four Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . C: That's not even But that's not possible to fill in , so we have to round it . A: But I'm filling in a three . A: Does it will so it will be a two point five . A: Yes , it is . A: I have a veto . A: Exactly . A: It's not about the content , it's about okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . D: Is it easy to find ? C: Yes . C: It it most definitely is it's very easy . A: Yeah , or beeps or yeah . B: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh But even without it Yeah . C: Yes . C: Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that . A: I'm here , I'm here . C: Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So something like that . C: So , I th Yeah , me too . A: Well , I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . A: Um Sebastian ? B: Me too . D: Yeah , I agree . A: Right , well . A: The feel of the remote control is spongy . A: Well , uh it can't be more spongy . A: So No okay , but but for the options given , it's the most spongy one . C: Well , it can be . C: There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . B: Was it one of our options ? C: No , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . D: No . D: Uh this this was a most spongy option . B: So , in the in Yeah . C: Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . A: Yeah . C: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . A: Yeah . C: They're out there . A: They're out there . B: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . C: Yes , but it's not good enough , so it's a two . A: Yeah . A: I'll give it a one . B: I wan I'll take one . C: You take one ? C: What do you give it ? D: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah . A: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . A: Because we need to go on in for the time . D: Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . B: It will be a one . D: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . C: No no no . C: Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . A: You are okay . A: The remote control offers enough features . A: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? D: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . D: So Yeah , depends . C: Basically it's it's completely programmable . A: Yeah . C: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . A: Yeah , I know . C: So it's quite advanced . A: What what we didn't talk about is um uh I think it has . B: Yeah , but it ha doesn't has the digits . B: I believe it's If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has . D: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Signal . A: Yeah . A: Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . C: Yes . A: So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . C: Has uh the signals sent to it . B: Yeah . A: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . A: So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . C: Absolutely . A: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . C: Yes . C: But that that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . A: Yeah . C: At at least uh forty buttons . A: Yeah . C: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . C: And this is quite s simple . C: You can use your voice to to programme it . A: Yep . C: It's Yeah , I'll give it a one . A: Yeah . A: Okay , um let's give it a number . A: I'll give it uh a one . A: For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . B: I'll give a two . D: Um I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . C: Yes . C: I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . C: So Hmm . A: Yeah . A: So high quality , low acceptance . A: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . C: Yes . A: But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . C: Mm-hmm . C: Mm-hmm . A: D do you agree ? C: Yes , I agree . C: I Yeah , okay . A: Yeah . A: Maybe we should have a radar uh function . C: But Yes . B: But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price ? B: Fifty ? A: Twenty five Euros . B: Uh twenty five . B: And costs were twelve fifty . A: Yeah . B: But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double , Think . B: Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ? A: Mm-hmm . B: So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah . C: M about fifty Euros . C: That's quite ex well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . B: That's price , but w w No . B: An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . C: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . C: It's quite expensive , yes . A: Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . C: Yes . C: Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . C: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . A: Yeah . A: Yeah . C: So I think it's worth its price . A: Okay . A: Um you had an overall rating . A: Um That's counting . D: Yeah , but uh with these ratings uh should be about one point s seven , yeah . C: Well , it's it's about one point five . B: Four six seven eight . C: Something like that . A: Okay . B: Nine divided by six . A: Okay . A: Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . A: About the project itself , not about the product . A: Um What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? A: Ruud ? A: Try to translate that . C: Well Well , I think Mm . B: Hmm . A: Any any other Uh , Roo ? B: Yeah , I think uh The process was good . D: Ye The prices . A: Roo . B: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . A: Yeah . B: And and that was the the big deal . B: I if we knew that before , we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah . C: Actually , we had Yes . A: Better decision . C: We had we had too little information actually . A: Yeah . C: So And uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . A: Less . C: So there was not really a process of uh Well Yes . A: Yeah . A: So we could we we could be we could've been creative . A: But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . C: Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . C: We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . A: Yeah . C: So We're tempered by that , yes . A: Yeah . A: Okay , Roo ? A: Any other thoughts on that ? B: No , no . A: Ruud ? D: I agree . A: You agree , okay . A: Uh leadership . B: Fantastic . A: Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . C: Yeah , okay . A: Okay . C: I think we're a good team . A: I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . A: I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh . C: Yes . B: Yeah . A: Um Yeah . C: Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . A: So um Yeah , but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . C: I think so too . B: Yeah . A: Yeah . A: Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . A: Did you like 'em ? C: Uh . C: The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . B: Yeah . C: It it's The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . A: Because of the response or Okay . B: Response and Uh it it has yeah . C: It's not accurate . A: Uh Okay , so it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? B: Yeah , it's not accurate . B: The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh Yeah , where it draws . D: Draws . B: It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen . B: So uh You to take in account that your you m yeah uh It's too slow Hmm . A: Uh yeah . C: Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds . A: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . A: Uh the one before , the third meeting . C: It is ? C: Okay . A: So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . C: Okay . A: Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? A: Or not at all ? D: No . A: Not at all . D: Not really . A: Okay . A: I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . C: I I think so too . C: Yes . B: Yep . C: Yes . B: If it has O_C_R_ , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . A: Yeah . B: It w it w yeah . B: It was necessary for me to uh Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . A: To digitise them . A: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: I type faster than I write . B: So Economic . A: Yeah . C: But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . A: Yeah . C: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . A: Yeah . C: I think it's a good product . C: I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . A: Yeah . C: It's not quite uh ergonomic . C: Eco ergonomic . A: I know . A: Yeah . A: Okay . A: Um What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? D: Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , so can't say much about it . A: Yeah . A: Okay , you can't really decide . A: No . A: I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . A: I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or Or the other way around , that you could show but m I know . C: Yes . D: No , or the other way around . B: Yeah . C: Yes , yes . C: That's quite what PowerPoint does . B: But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . D: Yeah . A: I know , but I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it . B: So it's almost yeah . B: Yep . A: We weren't able to do that . A: At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th Okay . B: Mm-hmm . B: A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . C: An object , yes . C: Yes . C: The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . B: I it's not possible yeah . C: And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . A: Yeah . C: And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . C: So it's Not not uh n not way . B: Oh it looks like paint actually . A: Okay , so y it it's not even as advanced as paint . A: Yeah . C: It's quite uh limited . A: Okay . A: Uh no . A: Yeah , the project is evaluated . A: Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . C: Okay . C: Oh , very good , celebration . A: Celebrate . C: Pop uh pop up the champagne . B: Great . B: It was a privilege working with you . A: Okay . A: Um you're dismissed . A: No , I think we are uh ready . C: Okay . B: To private rooms ? C: I see some action over there . A: Private room , Roo . A: That sounds quite scary . C: Okay . A: No , let's find uh the way to . C: uh we're done , we're finished , I believe . C: So , are there any more cycles in this process ? C: I think not . A: I don't believe so . A: Well , maybe we'd get an email . A: Thank you for your Forty minutes . C: But um how much time did we get for this meeting ? C: And how much time is left ? A: A minute or or ten maybe . A: M Yeah , ten or five . C: Ten minutes . C: Okay . C: Okay . A: So , we can uh redesign our uh Uh I would like to Oh . C: Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . C: A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . D: And no added value . C: No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . D: At all . D: So In interesting design . B: But you see the problem , y you can't continue your uh your line . A: Yeah . B: Well , it's fluffy alright . B: Spongy . C: What is that ? B: A giraffe ? A: Yeah . C: It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree . A: It's blue tongue . A: Yeah . A: This is a new model . A: But Blue tongue . C: So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . C: Or blue tongue . D: Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . D: So Yeah . A: It's spongy . A: That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . C: Blue tongue . C: Okay . A: Um Yeah , we're done here . B: Right . C: Let's wrap it up . A: Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation . C: Thank you Mister manager . C: Now , let's have uh a bottle of champagne . B: Leave it here . A: Yes . B: That's alright .","summary":"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate\/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints.. The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs. The same happened with the speech recognition. In order for the cost to come down to the original budget of 12.50, they also had to replace the rubber of the buttons with plastic and not use a curved design. The prototype proved extremely over budget. It would cost 22 euros. The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device. It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements. The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more.","enhanced_summary":"The meeting aimed to evaluate the project and product design, with participants discussing the usability and features of a remote control prototype. The team, including A, B, C, and D, debated the device's ease of use, innovative aspects, and sponginess, with varying opinions on its functionality and market appeal. They delved into the financial constraints, realizing the production costs exceeded the target price significantly. Decisions were made to simplify the design, focusing on cost-effective materials and basic functions to align with the target price of \u20ac25.

A: You're our Marketing Expert . D: Yes . D: Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . D: Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert . D: And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product . A: Okay , excellent . A: And you are User Interface Yeah . B: Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . B: I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view . A: Excellent . A: Okay . C: My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . C: First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like . D: Hmm . A: What should it look like ? A: Okay . D: Hmm . A: Oh , let's kick it off . A: Oh , there we go . A: So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . A: I took this off our corporate website . A: It's I think well it sums up what we need to do . A: We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . A: That's why our product will always fit in your home . A: So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . A: So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So So we put the fashion in electronics . A: So that's what we need to go for . A: Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . A: First step will be the functional design . D: Yeah . A: And that's basically what we're gonna do . A: Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . A: So skip through this . A: Uh . A: Okay . A: Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . A: We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . A: I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . A: Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . A: Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . A: That's it , you just put it on the board . A: You see a pen here . A: You go here , just like using a pen . A: You can just draw whatever you want . A: It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . A: And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . A: So it should be really easy . D: Okay . A: This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . A: We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . A: So I'll take this out . A: Okay . A: We'll use that later . A: Anyway . A: Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . A: I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . A: So next , been here . A: Well , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . A: So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . A: Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . A: I think the creative genius should go first . B: The creative genius ? B: Thank you very much . A: So , draw us your favourite animal . B: Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , but uh the animal which I Oh . A: Draw us a technical animal . A: Yeah , it's still erasing . B: Pen . B: Uh format . B: Else my animal will be like king-size . B: I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . B: Let's see . B: A head . B: actually worked with this . B: It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech . B: Bit low-responsive though . B: Prefer pen and paper . A: So that's what we don't want . A: We want a high-responsive product . A: So It looks more like nuclear bomb . D: Very nice dolphin . B: It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . B: This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want . B: So Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . A: Let's go easy on it . B: I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me . A: Anyway , it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents . C: Uh-huh . B: Like the ocean , like swimming . B: Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an Now we can forget this ever happened . A: What do you like ? A: Okay . A: Well , our Marketing Expert . A: Show us an animal . D: Um an animal . D: I like the elephant . A: Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet . A: Oh . D: What ? A: Take a clean sheet first . D: Yeah . D: Um Oh yeah . A: Just press next . A: That's it . D: Oh , a blank . D: Okay , next . D: Free , I like the elephant . D: It's big , it's strong , so uh uh Oh , it's a little bit You have to hold it , right ? B: It's not really that responsive , no . C: Mm . D: Hmm . D: It's a beautiful animal . D: Oh , you have to p press it pretty hard . D: With a smile on it , it's very important . A: It's a cute elephant . D: Yeah . D: And uh not to forget its tail . D: Oh . A: It's a nice beard . D: Yeah , it's okay . B: And you was making comments on my dolphin . D: Yes . D: I will beat the dolphin . D: No . A: Okay , so it's just a bee . D: Yeah . A: So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . A: The big and strong player in the market . D: Yeah . A: This would be good . D: Yeah . A: Okay , excellent . A: On to the next one . C: Okay . D: Uh yeah . C: Okay , you should press next . D: Yeah . A: Press next . A: Yeah , it's up there . C: Okay . A: That's it . C: Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . B: You picked a hard one , didn't you ? D: Experience with the tiger . C: My drawing skills are really bad , so . D: What ? D: They are Okay uh-huh . C: They are really bad , my drawing skills . A: Sure looks smooth . D: Oh . C: I'm not sure how the legs should go , but Uh these are stripes . B: Got it . C: I've picked this animal because it's very fast . C: It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . C: Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . A: What does it want ? C: Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . C: Uh it knows exactly what it wants . C: It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . C: And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . A: Okay . C: And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . D: Mm . C: And I think uh those things we can use . A: I agree . D: Okay . A: Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . A: I introduce to the world the amazing ant . D: Uh hard worker . A: Great team-workers . D: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . A: So I'm gonna give it a smiley face . D: Yeah , yeah . C: Oh . A: Not sure where the p . A: Just put 'em here . A: Whatever . A: Think it need shoes . A: So I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so That's the coolest ant ever . B: You've done this before , haven't you ? A: I love to draw ants . A: It's my hobby . A: Anyway Nah . A: Just I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . A: Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us . D: Yeah . A: Just Yeah . A: You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . A: Anyway . A: another beep to stop the meeting . A: See . A: Warning . A: Finish meeting now . A: Uh put this down . A: Examples . A: Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . A: So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short . A: I'll start with you . A: What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? B: Well , I basically had a question . A: What The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . B: Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? B: Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in Just for T_V_ remote control . D: Uh Yeah . A: Yeah , I guess so . B: Okay . B: Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . D: But Yeah . B: Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . B: No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes . A: Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . B: Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . B: So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . B: T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . B: Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? A: Yeah , we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . A: So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . A: Um yeah . A: I think we really need to cut the meeting short . A: You have anything you wanna share quickly ? C: Hmm . D: Uh . C: Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . C: That's it speaks for itself , but some uh Yeah . B: Yeah . A: It should be light , okay . D: Yeah . A: Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . A: Oh , this is it . A: Sorry , I skipped this sheet . D: Selling price . A: What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . A: That's for you . A: The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . C: Okay . A: Just go go for that . A: We'll reach the uh reach that profit . C: Okay . B: Okay , well that's not that much to work with . D: international . A: No , it's not much to work on . A: I'm sorry , I skipped it . A: Anyways , that's Yeah , this is it . A: Do you have anything you you came up with yet ? A: About uh marketing transfer , whatever ? D: Um about what ? D: Marketing ?

A: I'll see you back here in thirty minutes . D: Okay . D: Yes .","summary":"The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials. The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals. Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns. *NA* The remote is just going to be for TV. The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers. The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people. They also agreed to choose light materials. *NA*","enhanced_summary":"To kick off their first team meeting, Project Manager Mark introduced the participants: Dirk Meinfeld, the Marketing Expert; Nick Broer, the User Interface Designer; and Xavier Juergens, the Industrial Designer.

D: The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important . A: If I can cut in , is it people or men ? D: Uh People , sorry . A: Is it people , okay . D: Both women and men , yeah . A: Cause I thought it was only men , so 'Kay . D: Okay . D: Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . D: Um Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only So that's the most important things . B: That's pretty shocking uh . A: So we have to s we have to do something about that . A: Okay . D: Um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . A: Okay , just talk ahead . D: It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . A: Mm-hmm . D: Uh less important is tel teletext , uh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? A: Mm-hmm . A: Okay , that's okay . A: That's a little weird . D: Oh , the the no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings and uh Yeah . B: Which channel selection ? A: Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay . B: Oh , okay . D: Um new preferences preferences . D: Uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . A: That's like a button on your T_V_ ? A: Remote , okay . D: And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . A: Okay . D: And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? A: We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . D: Yeah . A: Preview what's on the channel . A: Okay . B: Is that manageable ? B: Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . A: That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue . D: Yeah . B: Okay . D: Yeah . D: Um Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so I can zap t to What ? A: Okay , you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . A: You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Recognise Yeah . A: Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel . D: Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like . A: Okay , so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it Okay . D: No , itself . D: Maybe it's easier to to sell it , but I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . A: Okay . A: I see . D: Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . D: It's a little bit uh I lost it , the computer uh crashed , so . A: Okay . B: Okay . A: No problem , it's it's okay , that's Yeah , go ahead . B: Shall I go ? B: Okay . D: Yeah . B: So , some technical functions . D: Darn computer . B: Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . D: Yeah . B: Uh let's just start with the method . B: It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . B: So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . B: We can do that . B: What goes wrong at the user . B: Gets the remote control . B: Where is the remote control ? B: We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , where's the remote control ? D: Yeah . B: That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , a really good idea . D: Yeah . A: That seems very good . B: Uh these are just the issues . B: I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . B: Searches for the button . B: There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . B: Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . D: Mm uh . A: Mm-hmm . B: Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . B: There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , yes . A: Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . A: Okay . B: Uh covered that . B: Oh yes , user presses the button . B: Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . B: So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . A: Okay , so the buttons should be Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . B: And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . A: Wow . A: The s Yeah . A: Make it make them bigger . A: Even more durable uh . A: Okay . B: Uh This I pretty much covered . B: So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . A: Yeah , it's true . D: Yeah . B: So that's basically uh what I had in mind . A: Yeah , that's clear . B: This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . A: No , of course uh Yeah . A: I must say that it Hmm . B: So that was it . A: That was it . A: Okay , that was good . A: So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget . B: Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . A: Okay . C: Okay , that's fine . C: Um . C: Okay , now work a little with me . C: Okay . C: Well , let's start it as it is . C: Okay , uh the method . C: There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . C: Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . C: Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . C: Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . A: Mm-hmm . C: And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? C: I'll tell you why that's important to me . C: Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . A: Mm-hmm . C: So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . C: So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . A: Yeah . A: Of course , hmm . B: Okay . C: Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . C: I have to check out how far I can go with that . C: Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . C: Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . C: Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . C: The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . A: You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . C: Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . A: Okay . A: Yeah , okay . C: So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . A: So you have Mm-hmm . C: This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . C: You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . C: The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . C: The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . C: You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? C: Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . C: Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . C: That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . C: Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . A: Okay . A: Okay . A: That was it ? C: That was it . A: I'll get back to my thing then . A: Uh Okay , back this up to the screen . A: So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . A: Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . B: Yeah . A: But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . A: Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . A: It's not important anymore . A: Um we're targeting young people now , because our um This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . D: Uh . D: Yeah . C: Hmm . A: I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah . D: B Yeah , and they want to pay for it and uh With more Where with more technical specifications in the Yeah . A: They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . A: If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . A: Yeah . A: see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . A: So With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . B: Oh . C: Yeah . A: Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . A: And sell the covers separately , for example . A: That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . A: So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . A: We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . C: Mm-hmm . A: So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . C: Hmm . A: So just I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . D: Yeah . A: Would you like to share ? C: No , I think this is a good idea . A: Okay . C: But Go ahead . D: But oh ? B: Is it manageable ? D: Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can Why ? B: Is it easy ? A: Oh yeah . A: I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , like you said . C: Y Yes , I think so too . B: Yeah . A: I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , it consumes batteries like hell . D: Nokia w Uh . A: I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . C: Yeah . B: And it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on a tight budget here . A: It costs a lot , I think . C: Okay , uh Mm . D: Okay . A: What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . A: For example , a little T_V_ guide . C: Hmm . A: Like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: I'm not sure it's even possible , but maybe okay , make it Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but What did I write down ? C: Hmm . C: I have to check that out , I'm not sure . D: Yeah . A: I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . C: That must be possible . A: I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . C: Ja . C: I'm sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . B: And it's Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . A: Uh speech recognition . A: I thin Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ? C: In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . C: Because that's not possible uh . A: Yeah , but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? C: Uh . C: Yeah . C: Exactly . A: A slap-on sticker . A: Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . D: Mm uh . B: Yeah , exactly . A: Yeah , that could be possible . A: A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . C: Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . A: I think it's universal . A: I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . C: If not Okay . D: Yeah . A: I think universal remote control should be possible . D: Um Everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w yeah . C: Okay , then I go for that . A: Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , so remote Okay , universal is good . C: Yeah . C: Okay . C: No , it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for . A: Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . A: So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . D: Yeah . D: Or one . D: Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , right ? B: And it's Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . A: Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . D: But Oh yeah . A: It's Yeah . D: Yeah . A: It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , so I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . D: Okay . B: It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . C: Uh-huh . D: Yeah . A: What else do we have ? A: Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . C: Mm-hmm . A: So the the the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first . C: Exactly . C: I already noted that . C: Mm , okay . C: Okay . A: Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . C: Hmm . A: Let's see . C: If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . C: That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . A: For example ? A: Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , we should remember that . D: Yeah . A: Everything we target is under forty , so . C: That's okay , okay . A: You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so No , of course . C: Huh . D: But b But every Oh . C: Uh okay . B: But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the C that's a problem with the with the text then . A: No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . C: Mm . A: Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . C: Okay . C: Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover . A: So it's a good and a bad idea . A: Mm-hmm . C: Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . C: Know what I mean ? B: Oh yeah , I know what you mean . C: It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh 'kay . A: Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , okay . D: Yeah . C: Exactly . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , that's what I something I have to look into . A: Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , so Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . C: Hmm . A: I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Okay . A: Um Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . A: I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself . B: Pretty straightforward . A: Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway . A: So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . A: Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . C: Mm . B: Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ? C: Yeah . A: That is true . C: I don't think so . A: No , that's true . C: No , I don't think so . C: Because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's Exactly , that's not possible . A: Yeah , that's true . B: It's an in-built menu , isn't it ? B: Yes . B: So basically we Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you Yeah , with the cover . A: I'm not sure if it's impossible , but uh there's a chance it's not , so . A: A double-sided remote control ? A: I don't think that's useful . B: I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , because No , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . A: Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . A: For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . C: Hmm . D: Yeah . B: Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , so Yeah . A: I don't think we should Yeah , for exam I'm not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . D: Mm yeah . C: Mm . C: Mm . C: But that might be broken . A: I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: Especially the big ones , the big brands , so . C: Hmm . A: Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . C: Hmm . A: Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing . C: Mm okay . C: Mm . C: But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . C: For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , that's true . D: Yeah . C: Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our Okay , I thi I think so too . A: I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , yeah . A: Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . C: And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . C: For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah . A: Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different . C: We should not do that . C: Exactly . D: Yeah . B: Yeah , I have some ideas . B: I have some ideas . A: Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . D: Um yeah . C: Mm that's your uh division . D: And uh with different colours uh . A: So um Yeah , this . B: I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . A: Not sure what because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . D: Okay . B: I heard a beep go . A: Yeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . D: Yeah . A: So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . A: I mean what do you want , do you want , but Yeah , may maybe something like this . B: Yeah , but we like some some curves or Yeah . A: But though smooth inside . A: So you have the transmitter here for example . A: Let's see that you what would be handy . D: Uh . A: I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . D: And a light uh Volume . A: Let's see one , two God damn it . B: Oh , we get the general ideas , yes . A: Yeah , okay . A: Another one here . A: Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . C: Hmm . B: Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah . A: Think it's like this . A: Withi within the Yeah , just take it . B: So you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? A: Do you take triangles or Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . D: Uh it's it's fine , I think . B: This is basically what people are accustomed to , so Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . C: Yeah . D: Oh d Yeah . A: Yeah . B: Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . A: Yeah , in the middle . A: It's it's usually uh there , but Mm . B: Whoa . C: Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . C: They they won't hear the the beep . A: Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . B: You won't be able to find it . C: Yeah . A: And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . C: Uh . C: Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . D: Just And L_E_D_ uh on it . A: Yeah . B: We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . C: So . C: deaf people ? A: Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . A: We could do that . D: Just a light on it or Very important . A: Uh let's see . B: So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? A: Oh yeah , it's true . A: Um that thing should be central . A: You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . D: Oh , that's It's And But you r And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . B: I usually press it on top . B: At least that's what I'm accustomed to . A: Yeah . C: I have another idea , I'm not sure if it's possible . A: Yeah , like that's gonna work . B: What would you like to ? A: Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to From top to bottom . A: Yeah , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . D: Yeah , so it's Yeah . C: Mm . A: So power button on top . A: Um Mute . B: Okay , mute button . B: Is that somewhere here ? A: Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . B: Is that used often ? D: So i it's sorry ? B: The mute button ? A: Mute . B: Do people use that often ? A: Turn the sound off . D: No , it's no . B: Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , but It's not that important , no . D: Uh . D: Hmm . A: I don't think it's important , but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here . D: Or or with the volume selection . A: No , because it Yeah , people are accustomed to that , it's Can I have that ? D: Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . D: I don't know where exactly , but Wha No . B: Sure . A: That's j Take this out and here see Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? A: I'm drawing triangles , but Yeah , it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . B: That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ? A: So anyway , I think this is should be the channels and or sh Here , okay . B: Well , I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . D: Yeah . C: Yeah , me too . D: Yeah , that's better . A: Okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel up and down . D: On the right . C: Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? C: That you don't have to buy new batteries if every Mm , yeah . D: Yeah . A: Well , for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . D: Maybe it's more ex expensive . C: Uh . A: You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . C: But that's already possible . B: But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? D: Yeah . A: I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . A: Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . C: Yes . C: Yes . C: Okay . C: Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger . A: How about I think I have a nice idea . C: So then you can choose , you have every decision . C: Know what I mean ? A: Not exactly uh . C: You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . D: Hmm . D: Yeah yeah . A: I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . C: So but But I think that will cost a lot . D: Yeah , that's g But Which Yeah . A: Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . C: Uh a normal wire would be better . A: I'm not sure . C: Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . A: A what ? C: You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station . A: Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . C: Yes . C: That is possible , that's true . A: It could be very flat , could be very small . A: It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example . C: Mm . A: And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . C: Yeah . C: Yeah . A: I don't think it's very expensive . B: But again , isn't that too expensive ? D: Yeah . B: Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station And do people actually want that ? A: I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r That's that you that's what you buy yourself . C: Mm . C: Yes . C: I'm going to try to find that out . C: I'm not sure if there's information available on this , but Hmm . A: It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible . D: But Yeah , they want to pay for it . B: To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? A: Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? D: Yeah . A: I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . D: Th uh there was not a el ask esque But But f hmm . A: Yeah . C: These are uh comfort issues . C: So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . C: Well , this is comfort . A: They want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , um and Yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . C: Yes . C: Hmm . C: Yeah . C: Exactly . C: I think this is a brilliant product . C: I would buy it myself . A: I think it would be good actually . A: I like the beep part anyway . C: Uh . A: So um let's go through the Covers is covers is good . C: I like the covers . C: That's a brilliant idea . B: Can can we save this or Yeah . C: I never thought I hope if I have information about that , I'm gonna Mm . A: Yeah , it's Oh we can save this . A: Up and saved . A: We even saved the ant . A: Um Okay . A: So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . A: Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . D: Yeah . A: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like . D: Yeah , okay . D: Yeah yeah yeah . C: Yeah . D: Yeah . C: I would like to make a decision . C: What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , I need it . A: Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , so . A: Hmm . B: Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh see some of it . D: Yeah . C: Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? A: No , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so . B: No , it's not . C: Not . B: No . A: So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . D: Yeah . D: My computer crashed , so uh I lost my uh presentation , but I have the uh Yeah , but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , and here is my here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and Ah yeah . C: Yeah , okay . A: I don't care . A: I haven't heard any complaints yet , so . B: Oh , your computer . B: Okay . A: Um Yeah , the oh , they inc uh they include the new one . B: Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . B: Let's see . A: Or just for you . B: Oh , where would we Where would we want the uh teletext button ? A: Oh no , I didn't have that . B: Because we decided that it's n not that important . D: And one And uh wha what people want , I've uh I have another thing uh Yeah . A: All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one . B: Do we put it somewhere over here ? A: Um other side . A: Yeah , let's increase it a little because Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important More or less . B: Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . B: Yeah . B: Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . B: I can put the other buttons in Yeah . A: Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best . C: What uh what did you wanna say ? A: Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . D: Um Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , not uh they want to No It's yeah , it's easy to learn wi and uh Um And The If Um If um Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . B: Yeah . B: Maybe another idea uh . C: Mm . C: Mm . A: Yeah , so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . C: Mm . B: Yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . A: Well what we had function that what people do , so . A: People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . A: That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . A: That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . A: Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . B: Yes , but it Because we're making We need to adjust to the technology . C: But that's the question , is it ? C: Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . A: Yeah , but But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . C: If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . C: I think so too . C: I think so too . B: True . C: Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? C: If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . C: Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . B: No , I thi Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . C: That's a bad bad com commercial for okay . A: Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . A: Under forty . A: Yeah ? C: That's true . D: Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah yeah . D: Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: The want to pay for Oh . D: So i yeah . C: Did they really said it like that ? C: Those two things . D: Yeah , and Yeah . C: Do they realise how much that costs ? A: Uh shall we ? C: That's almost undoable . A: Younger , age sixteen and forty five . D: Uh but If if they So uh we can We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno . A: That's all here , here it says Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . C: No , that's that's . C: Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . A: Okay , so we're not focusing on this . A: Um All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ oh here . A: Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . A: Hmm , okay ? C: Yeah , that's true . A: Speech recognition is quite Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive . C: Mm . D: Yeah . C: Hmm . D: How much it will cost and Um It will come uh Yeah . C: Uh . A: Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . C: Uh I But I really need finance information . B: Well I doubt it , but Well , I had basically Something like this . A: Me too . A: I mean we all do . C: We all do . A: Right . A: I think it's something we should put into consideration . A: Apparently it's what people want , so . C: Mm . A: We should see if what it costs , if it's possible . C: Uh . A: Yeah . A: Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . A: Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so . D: Different colours maybe . C: Hmm . C: And the design , it should differ . D: But all Okay . C: This is Philips , huh ? C: Philips has this . A: I have no clue . A: I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . C: Okay . C: Hmm . C: Uh . B: To make it kind of futuristic . C: Mm . C: Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , because I need to put all the electronics in it . A: I think it's a very Sorry ? C: If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it . A: Yeah ? A: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . A: I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . C: No . A: Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back ? B: So what kind of Yeah , sure . A: So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . A: Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . A: I'll just make it a little bigger now . A: So a transmitter here . A: Anyway . A: We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . A: So then we should probably put it here . A: It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . C: Hmm . A: Think it's a good place , people don't No ? D: If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . A: It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top . C: Me too . D: It's j Uh . C: Ah but . D: But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , uh because it's use it uh But nee the function of it . A: How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? D: So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot . D: So Yeah . A: Yeah , but why I I'm not sure . B: Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . A: Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . C: Hmm . C: No . C: M I personally would prefer it on the top . B: I'm I'm still not convinced of the Yeah . A: You would prefer it n Okay . C: Huh . A: So we have three people saying it should be on top . A: Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . C: But it Hmm . A: Anyways . D: It's expensive to build it , so you must use the maximum of it . C: Mm . A: Uh this looks a little About the L_C_D_s thing . C: Hmm . A: Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's cool . C: They want it uh . C: We should just try to make that if it's possible . C: If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . D: Huh . D: Uh . C: Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . D: But uh Yeah , I know uh . C: So I have to look if that's possible . C: But if we Hmm . B: So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . A: Uh we have green now uh Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . B: Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? D: In middle of it . D: In the middle . A: Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . A: I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . A: For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it I think the channel button should be in the centre . B: Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function . D: Yeah . D: It's the most import yeah . A: Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . A: Because it's uh We're not sure about the size anyway , just a general design . B: Well , that would make them quite small . B: So maybe you'd put them here . A: You can make it as big as you want . A: For example if you take uh No , let's see . B: Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . C: Hmm . A: For example just Yeah . C: If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . C: It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . C: That might be an option . A: I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . C: Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . A: Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . C: But it has to be a little bit heavier . C: Okay . A: The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . C: No , but the things behind it . C: space . A: Mm let's see . C: Like a process uh . D: Finish meeting now . D: It's on your computer . A: Finish meeting now . A: Okay , we will . B: So would we like this or would we like the Let's see what we have here . A: So either We either we have to decide what what people want . C: I like this one more . A: Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . A: So we have channel buttons here . A: I'm just drawing something uh . A: Uh I think this would this would look cool . A: You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . D: Uh . C: Mm . D: Or And uh what about speech recognition uh Yeah , yeah , but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . A: Well you can just no , I'm not sure if we can do that , but we could put a microphone in here for example . C: Mm . D: I think it's L_C_D_ is better now . A: Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . D: Yeah . C: I'll try to . D: Yeah . A: But let's cut the meeting for now yes . C: One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . B: Okay . D: Yeah , okay , yeah , that's yeah , that's okay . C: Shall we all try uh to think about a name ? B: So I think of a name . A: Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . A: Uh okay . D: Oh , good . A: Okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh . B: So Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch . D: Yeah . C: Good luck . A: Yeah , to all . D: Same . B: Yeah . C: Yeah , I've Do we uh save the ?","summary":"Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. On the other hand, materials should be more durable. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting. The ID will present the components concept. He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger. The UI will present the user interface concept. He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote. The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger. The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and\/or speech recognition. Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product. The target group will be people below 40. The remote will only be used for TV. The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device. Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols. It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up. The remote is going to be a universal one. Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those. The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour. The important buttons will be on top. Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project. The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable. Symbols on remotes fade with time. It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself. Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote. It is difficult to organise or limit the number of buttons in a way that makes the remote easier to use. The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons. Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive. Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive. In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the functional design phase, the team gathered for a meeting with A leading the discussion and participants B, C, and D sharing their presentations.

A: Detailed design oh , come on . A: Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . A: Uh Could open that anyway , think . A: Other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . A: We also that you're just busy with it . A: Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . A: Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . A: Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . A: Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . A: So then we ca yeah . A: We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . A: Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . A: So so , like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now , and it's bad . D: Hmm . A: Anyway . A: We are Oh . A: Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . A: So you could could present that . A: But um let's see what be handy to do . A: Nee no , you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because What ? C: I think it's more or less the same as we had . B: It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified . D: Hmm ? A: Oh that's hasn't changed that much , huh ? C: No much s No no no , not at all . A: I didn't expect anyway . A: You just coloured it . B: Uh s Final design . B: Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . A: Mm-hmm . B: We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A: I like the menu . B: A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . A: Mm-hmm . B: If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . B: So Probab Yeah . A: And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . A: It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . A: I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to Oh yeah . B: That's the be And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh So we have it's a bit round shaped , that's what we had uh We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . C: Hmm . C: Yeah , of course . D: Mm yeah . C: That's uh the integration story again . D: Okay . A: Mm-hmm . B: So that's basically what we chose there . A: Okay . B: If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . C: No , uh this is just a description of what we see there . C: So Speaks for itself . A: Yeah . D: Yeah . B: Oh . B: That's pretty much it . A: Okay . A: Now it's my time to ruin everything . A: Well , not ruin everything , but no , nah . B: Oh sorry . A: Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . A: We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . A: The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . A: So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . A: So well , we have sin one curve , a design . A: Rubber design . A: And we had a special colour . A: Suppose yellow is a special colour . A: So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . A: You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . C: Hmm . A: So , easy . D: Hmm . A: What do we scrap . A: Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . C: I d Yeah . B: I'd say that too . A: Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . C: Hmm . A: There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . A: But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . A: I think it's also harder to . B: Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with a normal remote control , which people already do . D: Yeah . C: Hmm . B: So Well , I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . A: So I ju I took that out . A: So and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . A: And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out . A: Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those . D: Pushbut Special colour , yeah . C: Huh . A: So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . A: We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . A: You make it d orange or whatever you want . A: It was a big issue , but I'll just go back . B: So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? A: Uh let's just let's see what okay , let's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . D: Yeah , it The p And the p What . A: It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so . C: Okay , but there's another problem . B: Okay . C: But there's another problem . C: If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . A: I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . C: Huh . C: Huh . C: Yeah . A: So I think yeah , it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . C: Right . C: I agree . A: And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . A: Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . A: But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . B: Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: We do . A: Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . A: B yeah , but those go together . A: And yeah , we could take out the curve . C: Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . B: We could take out a curve indeed . A: Could we could take out the curve . A: Is that an option ? C: Yes . A: For you ? C: Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . D: But uh the and Yeah . B: I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control So black and grey is okay . C: But Yeah . A: Yeah . A: I think it's it it does ruin it , but the fact that I t took that decision or t Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . D: The people Spongy , yeah . A: So you can change any colour you want . A: So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . C: Can we then not also uh change the material ? C: We take plastic for the basic cover and We can put those to the to the other covers . A: You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic . D: Yeah . D: And But But The people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? C: That's true . A: So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break . C: But okay . C: But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? C: Because we have to lose two things and I guess . A: I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . C: Yes . C: Okay , and that's enough ? A: Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because I guess those are the basic colours . A: So Oh . C: Hmm . B: Which we can fabricate , okay . A: I think those are basic col They want to To ensure the profit . A: That that's th that's the order . A: We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . D: Yeah . D: But we can take a risk . A: But that's not for our that's not our decision to take . B: No , we basically We need to stick to that . A: We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . D: Okay , yeah . C: Hmm . A: So Stick that . A: I don't think it's really bad either . A: I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have I think they would do . D: I hope the people will like it , but Yeah . A: Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . A: So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . C: Perhaps we should make m Huh . D: Yeah . D: The first sheet . A: So Well I don't think Yeah . C: Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . C: And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . C: Perhaps they decide tha Of course . A: Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer ? B: But they don't Well And if we So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve . A: Like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to True , but we did we didn't get that . C: Perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . C: We ca we uh we can at least tell them that You don't know that . A: So I think it's it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . C: Huh . C: No , I'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . A: But They could , but uh It's an option , but yeah , it's true . C: We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . C: It is an still an option , but not for this price . A: So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . A: We cannot contact them . A: It's just the order that we got . C: Exactly , but Hmm . D: Yeah . A: So that's what we gotta go with . A: So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , um or turn it yellow . D: Yeah . A: So It's uh something we have to decide on . C: I'd say lose the curve and the colour and Hmm . A: I say lose the curve . A: Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . A: Uh the curve . A: So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . D: Yeah , that's better . A: So this would this would be straight . B: So we could u still have the comfort . A: No , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . A: No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . A: Just like like that . C: Hmm . A: Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . A: we could make it yellow then , but You second that , you second that we lose the curve . B: I second that . B: No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . A: Okay , yeah . B: So that's not really that I would Yeah . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . C: Hmm . A: So we keep the curve . A: So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . A: And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . C: Oh . C: I agree . B: I would say I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . C: No . D: Yep . A: Mm-hmm . B: So we can always do that . A: Yeah , um I guess people are willing to pay for that . A: So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . D: Yeah . C: Hmm ? A: So I think that would still make it a nice product . C: Yes . A: Okay , we're final on that . A: So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . A: But anyways we're here . A: Um yeah . B: Which is basically what we discussed . A: This we discussed just now . A: That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . A: I mean , was kind of I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything cannot be for free . D: And I want to do that . A: We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . A: Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . B: Yes , we could have Well I hope it sells . C: Huh . C: Hmm . A: So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . D: Yeah . A: So Yeah . C: Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances . A: Yeah , I think would have been . D: Yeah . D: But Let's um see um Um Let's Uh Oh . A: Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . C: So Hmm . A: So I suppose Yeah , let's see if it sells . A: I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very very extended . A: But I suppose it sells , because it's good . A: I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . C: Hmm . D: Hmm . D: Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . D: Um I have some uh a method , a requirements and scale of . D: I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . A: Okay . A: Have been met , okay . D: And I will uh make a new blank sheet . A: Yeah . D: So so the buttons , the look and feel . D: I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel We are not Oh the menu button is it . B: Which are basically accessible through the menu button . A: They're stuck under menu . A: For the menu . C: Hmm . A: I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want , they have the simplicity they want . B: Yeah . D: Hi Oh , okay . D: Then it's all uh S it's true . A: I think it's very uh very well met . A: Either two or one maybe . C: One . A: I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . D: Yeah . A: So it could either be a two or a one . D: So d Oh wait . A: One and a half . D: Uh pen . B: Which is not an option . D: The p Oh yeah , it's red , okay , but Look and feel is everybo it's true . A: Just create our own option . A: Yeah . D: So Anyone ? D: And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . A: It's perfect . A: Even for deaf people , yeah . D: It's Yeah . C: Hmm . A: It's I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . B: To make it that way , yeah . A: Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . A: Maybe you can hear it . A: But I mean we tried , so I think it that's that deserves a one . D: And it's and it's yeah . A: Definitely . D: To . D: That's okay then . D: And the next one . D: How is that ? D: Uh w we had we don't have an uh manual , yeah . C: Manual . D: But I think that's a part of it . C: I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people . D: But Yeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh Yeah . A: I'd use an remote control . B: Mm yeah . C: So Yeah , I th Exactly . B: And it's pretty straight-forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . A: It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . C: No , that's true . C: I think it won't be a big problem . B: So One I d no , actu No , it it is pretty straight-forward . D: So it's a one or a I don't know . A: I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually . D: For the advanced uh settings . A: We didn't really discuss it , but I don't think it takes no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . D: No okay , that uh that's true . A: We took it s it's so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . D: Oh , so it Takes no ti Yeah . A: So I think that's yeah , we didn't it's either two or one , I guess . C: Ah . C: Um With the more important functions on . A: Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . A: So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . B: Yeah . B: Yeah . D: And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it . A: So just make that a two . D: Um mm Oh , it's a little bit learning . D: Okay . D: Uh yeah it's uh a little bit same . D: But it tells you or not ? C: Mm-hmm . A: You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . A: I think so . A: I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . A: I think so . D: But wha w oh , yeah . C: Mm-hmm . D: What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? D: Just uh only the channels and or What uh ? C: the menus uh Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those . B: Well , basically the menu options indeed . B: But No . D: Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen . A: No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . C: Yes . A: What does it display ? D: And for a channel selection , uh or that's not Yeah , I thought I thought too but yeah . A: Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible , but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . A: I don't think it's possible really . A: But the they didn't really define in what should be used for . D: But Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh Yeah . A: But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . C: Mm . A: Just for extra information on your programmes . D: Yeah , it must be clear then what what what for we use it . A: But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . B: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . A: I think it's good . A: No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . A: We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . A: Now we gave it enough thought though . D: Yeah . A: I think we d should just lower this . A: Maybe maybe it's a three though . A: We could've used it more effectively probably . D: Yeah , indeed . D: So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's W Yeah . C: Yes . B: Yeah . A: Yeah , we are using it , but it's not it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . B: Two or three . B: So You can seven . A: We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . D: Yeah . A: It's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , but okay . D: Yeah , I A three . C: Nah , it's not really only an extra . D: Ah , nothing , that's A seven . C: No menus . C: Think about Hmm . D: Uh that's uh Yeah . A: Can you talk to remote control ? B: Or we could say it Or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the C No , we don't have the colour . A: Well , it can't talk anymore . A: So we scrap that . A: Oh yeah Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . D: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . A: But you c you can talk to it . D: Not with the speech recognition . D: Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . D: So Yeah , uh um only in the curves . A: Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . A: Uh the shape i shape is i I think we yeah , I think that's okay . D: But the colours , we don't have special colours on it . A: Yeah , special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi We don't have it we do have it , it's just sold as a package . B: So I Yes , but the end product So Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we Yeah . D: Yeah , but we yeah , we don't have it , so d In the end product . C: But M Changing covers is also trend that we followed . A: It does it's not part of the basic product . A: It that that's what I call trendy . A: I mean the shape is trendy . A: The the sh the the functions are trendy . A: It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . D: Now But it's not a one . A: Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment . D: Yeah . D: Oh . C: Mm-hmm . A: It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . D: Oh well Oops . D: Oh it's a two , right ? C: Mm-hmm . D: On the last one . D: Uh that n that's all . B: Overall score . A: Overall score . D: Overall . D: It's um ten , sixteen three uh two two point seven or something like that . A: One two three . A: sixteen . A: Two two point some two point something . C: Hmm . D: I don't know why . B: Ten , sixteen , divided by Is two two third . C: Six . D: Six . A: Two and two thirds . D: Um So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay . A: It's okay , but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . D: Y not Yeah . C: Mm-hmm . B: There's Yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented . C: Mm-hmm . A: Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average . A: Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah , it would be under two . A: So I think we have even with this it's reasonable . D: Woah . D: Yeah . B: We come out on a average of two one eighth . A: Well I think it's two is okay . B: So which is pretty w good . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , two is pretty good . B: It's at least on the positive side . B: So We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , but Yeah . C: Hmm , of course . A: Definitely . D: Yeah . A: Yeah , I think it's probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . C: Mm-hmm . D: Yeah . A: We could have used it more efficiently , we just didn't think of it that way . D: Yeah . D: Yeah , with . B: True . A: So like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . D: The scale . C: But I think for this price , this is it's really a reasonable product . A: I think we div I think we did very well , uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . C: It's a good product . D: Yeah . D: With an L_C_D_ screen . C: Oh . A: It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . C: Oh . C: Yeah . A: So . C: But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this . D: Yeah , you can make 'em another one . A: They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . C: Hmm yeah . C: Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that . A: I don' think so . C: You cannot th think of that No , it's not . A: Uh it's just not it it's not affordable . A: Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . C: Mm-hmm . C: Oh It's also more attractive . A: Definitely . A: Okay , that was that . D: Yeah . D: Yeah . A: So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . B: So did you Yeah . A: Let's see , what was left in the the Another one . A: Hmm . A: Yeah , we evaluate the product . A: General project , what's i in For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . A: We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere . C: Hmm . D: Favourite channel . A: Well Anyways . A: Yeah , leadership is up to you . A: I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . A: But that's not for me to decide . D: Yeah , I know . A: I think we did pretty well as team-work though . D: Yeah . A: Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . C: Yes . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . D: Yeah , you're working separate . C: Yeah . A: Say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . D: Yeah . C: Huh . D: Yeah , yeah yeah . C: Hmm . A: So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone . C: Hmm . D: Yeah yeah yeah . D: Direct uh communication with yeah . B: And we could share information which we received . A: So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways . C: Hmm . C: That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . C: Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . C: So Oh . A: It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . D: Yeah . A: There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . B: Yeah . C: Hmm . A: So that was a little unclear I suppose . A: I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . A: I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . D: My handwriting is little bit yeah . D: Yeah . C: Hmm . B: Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , because The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . A: It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad . C: Hmm . A: It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should could be a lot better . D: But th that's Yeah , okay . A: Definitely . C: Mm-hmm . A: Yeah , it's true . B: So Oh can you ? C: But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . C: Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n Oh . A: No , you don't have to . D: No . A: No , you don't . A: I jin I didn't check the finish button . D: You can Done and then it's okay . A: I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . C: Okay , I saw that uh Hmm . A: Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done . A: Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically . A: But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . A: You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . C: Yeah , but I made Okay , but I made three pages and they were not finished . D: Oh , okay . D: Okay , yeah . C: And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further . A: Okay , before starting a ne a new page . D: Okay . A: Okay , that could be b . C: Exactly . C: So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . D: Oh . C: That's not possible . D: Hmm . C: You have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start a new one . A: Okay . B: Okay . A: Yeah , okay . C: That's not very uh handy , but if you know that , then it's not a problem . A: That's Yeah , it's understandable , okay . A: Any new ideas ? A: Yeah , more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . D: Important to mm Yeah . A: So I think that could have been better . A: But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else . C: Hmm . A: So Yeah , I think so . B: Yeah , well it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another . A: And l less p less spam probably . A: I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . C: Mm-hmm . C: Ah . C: Well Hmm . A: So which were totally useless actually . A: I thought I should probably look into them , but they were all useless . A: So I just Oh okay . B: Well , I personally did not have that , but That's probably your l description . D: Mm Yeah , after After five minutes , uh Yeah . B: But I also didn't not really . B: But still , you had that as well . C: Huh . B: Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information . C: Yeah . C: Yeah , Mm . B: There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay . A: I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . A: So that's that's kind of a It would change , but not for me . D: Email uh it's Yeah . A: So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . C: Hmm . C: Hmm . A: I couldn't do any research myself or I see , that's yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then But I was busy enough anyway . C: Hmm . A: So Any new ideas found ? C: Hmm . A: Or is that a 'cause uh yeah , it's well , probably is . C: No . B: How much time do we have for this anyway ? A: I have no clue . A: That's like oh,but it Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . A: So Uh okay , think that's about it . C: Okay , bring out the beer . B: Yeah . B: Champagne . D: I want one for my own . A: Uh I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished , right ? D: Yeah . A: What you ha from your assistant . C: I have no more email . A: So let's Okay , I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up . C: My coach is uh being very silent now . D: Yeah , my personal coach i What Yeah , name . A: I think we took very little time now , because Yeah , we're in agreement , everything the design is okay . A: The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . C: No , we haven't think above about that . A: How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ? B: Product name . C: Huh . C: It's better than thi I think than a serial number . C: Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . D: Or fruit name . A: Just oh , think of a catchy name . C: Uh Like fruit names . A: I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . A: So What ? D: Fruit name or something like that . D: The banana remote or something . A: Fruit ? A: You don't want it to resemble a banana . D: I don't know . D: Yeah , it's the form of it . B: The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore . A: It's not yellow anyway . D: Yeah oh , yeah . A: It's not yellow anymore . A: It is curved , but No , it's Hmm . D: Uh yeah . B: Well , uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , it's more Something with our company name , can we do anything with that ? D: Uh Yeah . C: Uh at least it's not something with numbers . C: Numbers are so meaningless to the people . C: I mean . D: That's true . D: Reaction , Real Reaction . B: Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . C: Real Reaction . B: The reaction deluxe . A: Real Reaction future R_C_ . A: Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . B: Is that a name or a c campaign ? A: No that's a that's a catchy slogan . B: Yeah . B: Or the The real reactor . A: Control your remote control . C: Real react . A: I go for future R_C_ probably . A: Something like It's short f Real reactor ? C: The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all . C: Yeah . B: You should write it down as a an option . C: Because our name is Real Reaction . A: Uh that that's That makes me think of different products than a remote control really . A: I'm not sure . A: Real reaction in a real Real reactor . D: Zapping . D: The Yeah , sure . B: So that's one option . A: Didn't notice . C: I'm looking for things in the name . A: Mm . C: So that the first three letters are s the same . B: Should I write the banana down or Sure ? C: R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . A: I take f yeah , take a banana . D: The banana . A: Hmm . D: Remote . D: Banana recei R_C_ . C: The triple R_ . C: Real Reaction remotes control . D: Remote . B: Well I Uh do you mean it like You mean it like this ? C: Triple R_ . D: R_ three C_ . D: R_ three C_ . C: yeah . C: Yeah , that . D: Real Reaction Remote Control . D: R_ three C_ . D: Oh yeah . A: No , not like that . A: It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . C: I think triple R_ . C: Doesn't sound ? A: Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe Oh . D: Yeah , triple R_ . C: Yeah . A: Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . D: Triple R_C_ . C: Ah . D: The triple R_C_ , yeah . A: Yeah . D: R_ s R_ three C_ . A: R_ dash C_ . B: Dash C_ ? C: I think I like it like this more . A: Dash . A: Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? B: Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ? D: Triple R_ dash . A: How about do both ? A: Sure if it looks stupid .

D: Mm .","summary":"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK. It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. The latter was taken out, along with the special colour. Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2). Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R. The PM is going to finish the project report. The UI and ID will send him their design to include. Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design. They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look. The remote control is going to be called Triple-R. The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget. It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out. There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers. Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested. They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit. The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews. Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time. Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time. The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information.","enhanced_summary":"To kick off the meeting, the team gathered to finalize the detailed design of their remote control product. Participants included A, the team leader, B, C, and D, discussing various design elements like material choice, color scheme, and features such as LCD display and speech recognition. They grappled with financial constraints, aiming to keep production costs under \u20ac12.50 per unit. After a thorough evaluation, they decided to scrap the speech recognition feature to meet budget constraints, focusing on LCD display functionality. Action items included naming the product, with the team settling on \"Triple R_\" for Real Reaction Remote Control. Despite some technical hiccups with saving design images, the team wrapped up efficiently, with A heading off to complete the final report, ensuring the project's success within budget. The meeting showcased effective teamwork, creative problem-solving, and a focus on meeting user requirements while balancing financial limitations.","relevance":0.4494966567,"qa_pairs_json":[{"question":"What was the team's decision regarding the speech recognition feature?","answer":"The team decided to scrap the speech recognition feature to meet budget constraints."},{"question":"What name did the team choose for the remote control product?","answer":"The team settled on 'Triple R_' for Real Reaction Remote Control."},{"question":"What action items were discussed during the meeting?","answer":"Action items included naming the product and finalizing the detailed design."},{"question":"What were some key aspects of the meeting?","answer":"The meeting showcased effective teamwork, creative problem-solving, and a focus on meeting user requirements while balancing financial limitations."}]}
